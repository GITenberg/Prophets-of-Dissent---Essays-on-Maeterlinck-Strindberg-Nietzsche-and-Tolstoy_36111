<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_vii" title="vii"> </a>Preface</h2>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> collocation of authors so widely at variance
in their moral and artistic aims as are those assembled
in this little book may be defended by
the safe and simple argument that all of these
authors have exerted, each in his own way, an
influence of singular range and potency. By fairly
general consent they are the foremost literary
expositors of important modern tendencies. It
is, therefore, of no consequence whether or not
their ways of thinking fit into our particular
frame of mind; what really matters is that in this
small group of writers more clearly perhaps than
in any other similarly restricted group the basic
issues of the modern struggle for social transformation
appear to be clearly and sharply joined.
That in viewing them as indicators of contrarious
ideal currents due allowance must be made
for peculiarities of temperament, both individual
and racial, and, correspondingly, for the purely
&ldquo;personal equation&rdquo; in their spiritual attitudes,
does not detract to any material degree from their
generic significance.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_viii" title="viii"> </a>In any case, there are those of us who in the
vortical change of the social order through which
we are whirling, feel a desire to orient ourselves
through an objective interest in letters among the
embattled purposes and policies which are now
gripped in a final test of strength. In a crisis
that makes the very foundations of civilization
quake, and at a moment when the salvation of
human liberty seems to depend upon the success
of a united stand of all the modern forces of life
against the destructive impact of the most primitive
and savage of all the instincts, would it not
be absurdly pedantic for a critical student of literature
to resort to any artificial selection and co-ordination
of his material in order to please the
prudes and the pedagogues? And is it not natural
to seek that material among the largest literary
apparitions of the age?</p>

<p>It is my opinion, then, that the four great authors
discussed in the following pages stand, respectively,
for the determining strains in a great
upsetting movement, and that in the aggregate
they bring to view the composite mental and moral
impulsion of the times. Through such forceful
articulations of current movements the more percipient
class of readers have for a long time been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_ix" title="ix"> </a>
enabled to foresense, in a manner, the colossal reconstruction
of society which needs must follow
this monstrous, but presumably final, clash between
the irreconcilable elements in the contrasted
principles of right and might, the masses and the
monarchs.</p>

<p>However, the gathering together of Maeterlinck,
Nietzsche, Strindberg, and Tolstoy under
the hospitality of a common book-cover permits
of a supplementary explanation on the ground of
a certain fundamental likeness far stronger than
their only too obvious diversities. They are, one
and all, radicals in thought, and, with differing
strength of intention, reformers of society, inasmuch
as their speculations and aspirations are
relevant to practical problems of living. And yet
what gives them such a durable hold on our attention
is not their particular apostolate, but the
fact that their artistic impulses ascend from the
<ins title="sublimal">subliminal</ins> regions of the inner life, and that their
work somehow brings one into touch with the hidden
springs of human action and human fate.
This means, in effect, that all of them are mystics
by original cast of mind and that notwithstanding
any difference, however apparently violent, of
views and theories, they follow the same introspective
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_x" title="x"> </a>
path towards the recognition and interpretation
of the law of life. From widely separated
ethical premises they thus arrive at an essentially
uniform appraisal of personal happiness as a function
of living.</p>

<p>To those readers who are not disposed to grant
the validity of the explanations I have offered,
perhaps equality of rank in artistic importance
may seem a sufficient criterion for the association
of authors, and, apart from all sociologic and
philosophic considerations, they may be willing to
accept my somewhat arbitrary selection on this
single count.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>I<br/>
<small>THE MYSTICISM OF MAURICE MAETERLINCK</small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Under</span> the terrific atmospheric pressure
that has been torturing the civilization of
the entire world since the outbreak of the
greatest of wars, contemporary literature of the
major cast appears to have gone into decline.
Even the comparatively few writers recognized
as possessing talents of the first magnitude have
given way to that pressure and have shrunk to
minor size, so that it may be seriously questioned,
to say the least, whether during the past forty
months or so a single literary work of outstanding
and sustained grandeur has been achieved anywhere.
That the effect of the universal embattlement
upon the art of letters should be, in the
main, extremely depressing, is quite natural; but
the conspicuous loss of breadth and poise in writers
of the first order seems less in accordance
with necessity,&mdash;at least one might expect a very
superior author to rise above that necessity. In
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>
any case it is very surprising that it should be a
Belgian whose literary personality is almost
unique in having remained exempt from the general
abridgment of spiritual stature.</p>

<p>It is true that Maurice Maeterlinck, the most
eminent literary figure in his sadly stricken country
and of unsurpassed standing among the contemporary
masters of French letters, has, since
the great catastrophe, won no new laurels as a
dramatist; and that in the other field cultivated
by him, that of the essay, his productiveness has
been anything but prolific. But in his case one is
inclined to interpret reticence as an eloquent proof
of a singularly heroic firmness of character at a
time when on both sides of the great divide which
now separates the peoples, the cosmopolitan trend
of human advance has come to a temporary halt,
and the nations have relapsed from their laboriously
attained degree of world-citizenship into
the homelier, but more immediately virtuous, state
of traditional patriotism.</p>

<p>It is a military necessity as well as a birthright
of human nature that at a time like the
present the patriot is excused from any pharisaical
profession of loving his enemy. Before the war,
Maeterlinck's writings were animated by humanitarian
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>
sympathies of the broadest catholicity. He
even had a peculiar affection for the Germans, because
doubtless he perceived the existence of a
strong kinship between certain essential traits in
his spiritual composition and the fundamental tendencies
of German philosophy and art. But when
Belgium was lawlessly invaded, her ancient towns
heinously destroyed, her soil laid waste and
drenched with the blood of her people, Maeterlinck,
as a son of Belgium, learned to hate the
Germans to the utmost of a wise and temperate
man's capacity for hatred, and in his war papers
collected in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Débris de la Guerre</i>, (1916),<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
which ring with the passionate impulse of the patriot,
his outraged sense of justice prevails over
the disciplined self-command of the stoic.</p>

<p>He refuses to acquiesce in the lenient discrimination
between the guilty Government of Germany
and her innocent population: &ldquo;It is not true that
in this gigantic crime there are innocent and guilty,
or degrees of guilt. They stand on one level, all
those who have taken part in it&hellip;. It is, very
simply, the German, from one end of his country
to the other, who stands revealed as a beast of
prey which the firm will of our planet finally repudiates.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
We have here no wretched slaves
dragged along by a tyrant king who alone is responsible.
Nations have the government which
they deserve, or rather, the government which
they have is truly no more than the magnified and
public projection of the private morality and mentality
of the nation&hellip;. No nation can be deceived
that does not wish to be deceived; and it
is not intelligence that Germany lacks&hellip;. No
nation permits herself to be coerced to the one
crime that man cannot pardon. It is of her own
accord that she hastens towards it; her chief has
no need to persuade, it is she who urges him on.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">(2)</a></p>

<p>Such a condemnatory tirade against the despoilers
of his fair homeland was normally to be expected
from a man of Maeterlinck's depth of feeling.
The unexpected thing that happened not
long after was that the impulsive promptings of
justice and patriotism put themselves into harmony
with the guiding principles of his entire moral
evolution. The integrity of his philosophy of life,
the sterling honesty of his teachings, were thus
loyally sealed with the very blood of his heart.&mdash;&ldquo;Before
closing this book,&rdquo; he says in the Epilogue,<a name="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">(3)</a>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>
&ldquo;I wish to weigh for the last time in my
conscience the words of hatred and malediction
which it has made me speak in spite of myself.&rdquo;
And then, true prophet that he is, he speaks forth
as a voice from the future, admonishing men to
prepare for the time when the war is over. What
saner advice could at this critical time be given
the stay-at-homes than that they should follow
the example of the men who return from the
trenches? &ldquo;They detest the enemy,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but
they do not hate the man. They recognize in him
a brother in misfortune who, like themselves, is
submitting to duties and laws which, like themselves,
he too believes lofty and necessary.&rdquo; On
the other hand, too, not many have sensed as
deeply as has Maeterlinck the grandeur to which
humanity has risen through the immeasurable
pathos of the war. &ldquo;Setting aside the unpardonable
aggression and the inexpiable violation of the
treaties, this war, despite its insanity, has come
near to being a bloody but magnificent proof of
greatness, heroism, and the spirit of sacrifice.&rdquo;
And from his profound anguish over the fate of
his beloved Belgium this consolation is wrung:
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
&ldquo;If it be true, as I believe, that humanity is worth
just as much as the sum total of latent heroism
which it contains, then we may declare that humanity
was never stronger nor more exemplary
than now and that it is at this moment reaching
one of its highest points and capable of braving
everything and hoping everything. And it is for
this reason that, despite our present sadness, we
are entitled to congratulate ourselves and to rejoice.&rdquo;
Altogether, Maeterlinck's thoughts and
actions throughout this yet unfinished mighty fate-drama
of history challenge the highest respect for
the clarity of his intellect and the profoundness of
his humanity.</p>

<p>The appalling disaster that has befallen the
Belgian people is sure to stamp their national character
with indelible marks; so that it is safe to
predict that never again will the type of civilization
which before the war reigned in the basins
of the Meuse and the Scheldt reëstablish itself in
its full peculiarity and distinctiveness which was
the result of a unique coagency of Germanic and
Romanic ingredients of culture. Yet in the amalgam
of the two heterogeneous elements a certain
competitive antithesis had survived, and manifested
itself, in the individual as in the national
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
life at large, in a number of unreconciled temperamental
contrasts, and in the fundamental unlikeness
exhibited in the material and the spiritual activities.
Witness the contrast between the bustling
aggressiveness in the province of practical affairs
and the metaphysical drift of modern Flemish art.
To any one familiar with the visible materialism
of the population in its external mode of living
it may have seemed strange to notice how sedulously
a numerous set among the younger artists
of the land were facing away from their concrete
environment, as though to their over-sensitive
nervous system it were irremediably offensive.
The vigorous solidity of Constantin Meunier, the
great plastic interpreter of the &ldquo;Black Country&rdquo;
of Belgium, found but few wholehearted imitators
among the sculptors, while among the painters
that robust terrestrialism of which the work of a
Rubens or Teniers and their countless disciples
was the artistic upshot, was almost totally relinquished,
and linear firmness and colorful vitality
yielded the day to pallid, discarnately decorative
artistry even, in a measure, in the &ldquo;applied art&rdquo;
products of a Henri van de Velde.</p>

<p>It is in the field of literature, naturally enough,
that the contrast is resolved and integrated into
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
a characteristic unity. Very recently Professor
A.&nbsp;J. Carnoy has definitely pointed out<a name="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> the
striking commixture of the realistic and imaginative
elements in the work of the Flemish symbolists.
&ldquo;The vision of the Flemings&rdquo;&mdash;quoting from
his own <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">précis</i> of his paper&mdash;&ldquo;is very concrete,
very exact in all details and gives a durable, real,
and almost corporeal presence to the creations of
the imagination. All these traits are exhibited in
the reveries of the Flemish mystics, ancient and
modern. One finds them also no less plainly in
the poetic work of Belgian writers of the last
generation: Maeterlinck, Verhaeren, Rodenbach,
Van Lerberghe, Le Roy, Elskamp, etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If we take into account this composite attitude
of the Flemish mind we shall be less surprised at
the remarkable evolution of a poet-philosopher
whose creations seem at first blush to bear no resemblance
to the outward complexion of his own
age; who seems as far removed temperamentally
from his locality and time as were his lineal spiritual
ancestors: the Dutchman Ruysbroeck, the
Scandinavian Swedenborg, the German Novalis,
and the American Emerson&mdash;and who in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
zenith of his career stands forth as an ardent advocate
of practical action while at the same time a
firm believer in the transcendental.</p>

<p>Maeterlinck's romantic antipathy towards the
main drift of the age was a phenomenon which at
the dawn of our century could be observed in a
great number of superior intelligences. Those
fugitives from the dun and sordid materialism of
the day were likely to choose between two avenues
of escape, according to their greater or lesser
inner ruggedness. The more aggressive type
would engage in multiform warfare for the reconstruction
of life on sounder principles; whereas
the more meditative professed a real or affected
indifference to practical things and eschewed any
participation in the world's struggle for progress.
And of the quiescent rather than the insurgent
variety of the romantic temper Maurice Maeterlinck
was the foremost exponent.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;romantic longing&rdquo; seems to have come
into the world in the company of the Christian religion
with which it shares its partly outspoken,
partly implied repugnance for the battle of life.
Romantic periods occur in the history of civilization
whenever a sufficiently influential set of artistically
minded persons have persuaded themselves
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>
that, in quite a literal sense of the colloquial
phrase, they &ldquo;have no use&rdquo; for the world; a discovery
which would still be true were it stated
obversely. The romantic world-view, thus fundamentally
oriented by world-contempt, entails, at
least in theory, the repudiation of all earthly
joys&mdash;notably the joy of working&mdash;and the renouncement
of all worldly ambition; it scorns the
cooperative, social disposition, invites the soul to
a progressive withdrawal into the inner ego, and
ends in complete surrender to one sole aspiration:
the search of the higher vision, the vision, that is,
of things beyond their tangible reality. To such
mystical constructions of the inner eye a certain
group of German writers who flourished in the
beginning of the nineteenth century and were
known as the Romantics, darkly groped their way
out of the confining realities of their own time.
The most modern spell of romanticism, the one
through which our own generation was but yesterday
passing, measures its difference from any previous
romantic era by the difference between
earlier states of culture and our own. Life with
us is conspicuously more assertive and aggressive
in its social than in its individual expressions, which
was by no means always so, and unless the romantic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>
predisposition adapted itself to this important
change it could not relate itself at all intimately
to our interests. Our study of Maeterlinck
should help us, therefore, to discover possibly in
the new romantic tendency some practical and
vital bearings.</p>

<p>We find that in the new romanticism esthetic
and philosophical impulses are inextricably mixed.
Hence the new movement is also playing an indispensable
rôle in the modern re-foundation of art.
For while acting as a wholesome offset to the so-called
naturalism, in its firm refusal to limit inner
life to the superficial realities, it at the same time
combines with naturalism into a complete recoiling,
both of the intellect and the emotions, from
any commonplace, or pusillanimous, or mechanical
practices of artistry. This latter-day romanticism,
moreover, notwithstanding its sky-aspiring
outstretch, is akin to naturalism in that, after all,
it keeps its roots firmly grounded in the earth;
that is to say, it seeks for its ulterior sanctions not
in realms high beyond the self; rather it looks
within for the &ldquo;blue flower&rdquo; of contentedness. Already
to the romantics of old the mystic road to
happiness was not unknown. It is, for instance,
pointed by Novalis: &ldquo;Inward leads the mysterious
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
way. Within us or nowhere lies eternity with
its worlds; within us or nowhere are the past and
the future.&rdquo; Viewed separately from other elements
of romanticism, this passion for retreating
within the central ego is commonly referred to as
mysticism; it has a strong hold on many among the
moderns, and Maurice Maeterlinck to be properly
understood has to be understood as the poet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par
excellence</i> of modern mysticism. By virtue of this
special office he deals mainly in concepts of the
transcendental, which puzzles the ordinary person
accustomed to perceive only material and ephemeral
realities. Maeterlinck holds that nothing
matters that is not eternal and that what keeps us
from enjoying the treasures of the universe is the
hereditary resignation with which we tarry in the
gloomy prison of our senses. &ldquo;In reality, we
live only from soul to soul, and we are gods who
do not know each other.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> It follows from this
metaphysical foundation of his art that instead of
the grosser terminology suitable to plain realities,
Maeterlinck must depend upon a code of subtle
messages in order to establish between himself
and his audience a line of spiritual communication.
This makes it somewhat difficult for people of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
cruder endowment to appreciate his meaning, a
grievance from which in the beginning many of
them sought redress in facile scoffing. Obtuse
minds are prone to claim a right to fathom the
profound meanings of genius with the same ease
with which they expect to catch the meaning of
a bill of fare or the daily stock market report.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that even those
to whom Maeterlinck's sphere of thought is not
so utterly sealed, enter it with a sense of mixed
perplexity and apprehension. They feel themselves
helplessly conducted through a world situated
beyond the confines of their normal consciousness,
and in this strange world everything that
comes to pass appears at first extremely impracticable
and unreal. The action seems &ldquo;wholly dissevered
from common sense and ordinary uses;&rdquo;
the figures behave otherwise than humans; the
dialogue is &ldquo;poised on the edge of a precipice of
bathos.&rdquo; It is clear that works so far out of the
common have to be approached from the poet's
own point of view. &ldquo;Let the reader move his
standpoint one inch nearer the popular standpoint,&rdquo;
thus we are warned by Mr. G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton,
&ldquo;and his attitude towards the poet will be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>
harsh, hostile, unconquerable mirth.&rdquo; There are
some works that can be appreciated for their
good story, even if we fail to realize the author's
moral attitude, let alone to grasp the deeper content
of his work. &ldquo;But if we take a play by Maeterlinck
we shall find that unless we grasp the particular
fairy thread of thought the poet rather
lazily flings to us, we cannot grasp anything whatever.
Except from one extreme poetic point of
view, the thing is not a play; it is not a bad play,
it is a mass of clotted nonsense. One whole act
describes the lovers going to look for a ring in a
distant cave when they both know they have
dropped it down the well. Seen from some secret
window on some special side of the soul's turret,
this might convey a sense of faerie futility in our
human life. But it is quite obvious that unless it
called forth that one kind of sympathy, it would
call forth nothing but laughter. In the same play,
the husband chases his wife with a drawn sword,
the wife remarking at intervals, &lsquo;I am not gay.&rsquo;
Now there may really be an idea in this; the idea
of human misfortune coming most cruelly upon the
opportunism of innocence; that the lonely human
heart says, like a child at a party, &lsquo;I am not enjoying
myself as I thought I should.&rsquo; But it is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
plain that unless one thinks of this idea, and of
this idea only, the expression is not in the least
unsuccessful pathos,&mdash;it is very broad and highly
successful farce!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the atmosphere of Maeterlinck's plays
is impregnated throughout with oppressive mysteries,
and until the key of these mysteries is found
there is very little meaning to the plays. Moreover,
these mysteries, be they never so stern and
awe-inspiring, are irresistibly alluring. The reason
is, they are our own mysteries that have somehow
escaped our grasp, and that we fain would
recapture, because there dwells in every human
breast a vague assent to the immortal truth of
Goethe's assertion: &ldquo;The thrill of awe is man's
best heritage.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">(6)</a></p>

<p>The imaginative equipment of Maeterlinck's
dramaturgy is rather limited and, on its face value,
trite. In particular are his dramatis personae
creatures by no means calculated to overawe by
some extraordinary weirdness or power. And yet
we feel ourselves touched by an elemental dread
and by an overwhelming sense of our human impotence
in the presence of these figures who, without
seeming supernatural, are certainly not of common
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>
flesh and blood; they impress us as surpassingly
strange mainly because somehow they are instinct
with a life fundamentally more real than the superficial
reality we know. For they are the mediums
and oracles of the fateful powers that stir human
beings into action.</p>

<p>The poet of mysticism, then, delves into the
mystic sources of our deeds, and makes us stand
reverent with him before the unknowable forces
by which we are controlled. Naturally he is
obliged to shape his visions in dim outline. His
aim is to shadow forth that which no naked eye
can see, and it may be said in passing that he attains
this aim with a mastery and completeness
incomparably beyond the dubious skill displayed
more recently by the grotesque gropings of the so-called
futurist school. Perhaps one true secret of
the perturbing strangeness of Maeterlinck's figures
lies in the fact that the basic principle of their life,
the one thoroughly vital element in them, if it does
not sound too paradoxical to say so, is the idea of
death. Maeterlinck's mood and temper are fully
in keeping with the religious dogma that life is but
a short dream&mdash;with Goethe he believes that &ldquo;all
things transitory but as symbols are sent,&rdquo; and
apparently concurs in the creed voiced by one of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
Arthur Schnitzler's characters,&mdash;that death is the
only subject in life worthy of being pondered by
the serious mind. &ldquo;From our death onwards,&rdquo;
so he puts it somewhere, &ldquo;the adventure of the
universe becomes our own adventure.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It will be useful to have a bit of personal information
concerning our author. He started his
active career as a barrister; not by any means auspiciously,
it seems, for already in his twenty-seventh
year he laid the toga aside. Experience
had convinced him that in the forum there were
no laurels for him to pluck. The specific qualities
that make for success at the bar were conspicuously
lacking in his make-up. Far from being eloquent,
he has at all times been noted for an unparalleled
proficiency in the art of self-defensive
silence. He shuns banal conversation and the
sterile distractions of promiscuous social intercourse,
dreads the hubbub of the city, and has an
intense dislike for travel, to which he resorts only
as a last means of escape from interviewers, reporters,
and admirers. Maeterlinck, it is seen, is
anything but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multorum vir hominum</i>. In order to
preserve intact his love of humanity, he finds it
expedient to live for the most part by himself,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>
away from the throng &ldquo;whose very plaudits give
the heart a pang;&rdquo; his fame has always been a
source of annoyance to him. The only company
he covets is that of the contemplative thinkers of
bygone days,&mdash;the mystics, gnostics, cabalists, neo-Platonists.
Swedenborg and Plotinus are perhaps
his greatest favorites. That the war has produced
a mighty agitation in the habitual calm of
the great Belgian poet-philosopher goes without
saying. His love of justice no less than his love of
his country aroused every red corpuscle in his
virile personality to violent resentment against the
invader. Since the war broke out, however, he
has published nothing besides a number of ringingly
eloquent and singularly pathetic articles and
appeals,&mdash;so that the character portrait derived
from the body of his work has not at this time
lost its application to his personality.</p>

<p>In cast of mind, Maeterlinck is sombrously
meditative, and he has been wise in framing his
outer existence so that it would accord with his
habitual detachment. The greater part of his
time used to be divided between his charming retreat
at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quatre Chemins</i>, near Grasse, and the
grand old abbey of St. Wandrille in Normandy,
which he managed to snatch in the very nick of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>
time from the tightening clutch of a manufacturing
concern. With the temperament of a hermit, he
has been, nevertheless, a keen observer of life,
though one preferring to watch the motley spectacle
from the aristocratic privacy of his box,
sheltered, as it were, from prying curiosity. Well
on in middle age, he is still an enthusiastic out-of-doors
man,&mdash;gardener, naturalist, pedestrian,
wheelman, and motorist, and commands an extraordinary
amount of special knowledge in a variety
of sports and sciences. In &ldquo;The Double Garden&rdquo;
he discusses the automobile with the authority
of an expert watt-man and mechanician. In
one of his other books he evinces an extraordinary
erudition in all matters pertaining to the higher
education of dogs; and his work on &ldquo;The Life of
the Bee&rdquo; passes him beyond question with high
rank among &ldquo;thirty-third degree&rdquo; apiculturists.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics that seem to separate
his books, especially those of the earlier period,
from the literary tendencies of his age, is their
surprising inattention to present social struggles.
His metaphysical bias makes him dwell almost exclusively,
and with great moral and logical consistency,
on aspects of life that are slightly considered
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
by the majority of men yet which he regards
as ulteriorly of sole importance.</p>

<p>When men like Maeterlinck are encountered in
the world of practical affairs, they are bound to
impress us as odd, because of this inversion of the
ordinary policies of behavior. But before classing
them as &ldquo;cranks,&rdquo; we might well ask ourselves
whether their appraisal of the component values
of life does not, after all, correspond better to
their true relativity than does our own habitual
evaluation. With the average social being, the
transcendental bearing of a proposition is synonymous
with its practical unimportance. But in his
essay on &ldquo;The Invisible Goodness&rdquo; Maeterlinck
quite properly raises the question: &ldquo;Is visible life
alone of consequence, and are we made up only of
things that can be grasped and handled like pebbles
in the road?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throughout his career Maeterlinck reveals himself
in the double aspect of poet and philosopher.
In the first period his philosophy, as has already
been amply hinted, is characterized chiefly by aversion
from the externalities of life, and by that
tense introversion of the mind which forms the
mystic's main avenue to the goal of knowledge.
But if, in order to find the key to his tragedies and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>
puppet plays, we go to the thirteen essays representing
the earlier trend of his philosophy and issued
in 1896 under the collective title, &ldquo;The
Treasure of the Humble,&rdquo; we discover easily that
his cast of mysticism is very different from that of
his philosophic predecessors and teachers in the
fourteenth and nineteenth centuries, in particular
from the devotional mysticism of the &ldquo;Admirable&rdquo;
John Ruysbroeck, and Friedrich von Hardenberg-Novalis.
Maeterlinck does not strive after the so-called
&ldquo;spiritual espousals,&rdquo; expounded by the
&ldquo;doctor ecstaticus,&rdquo; Ruysbroeck, in his celebrated
treatise where Christ is symbolized as the divine
groom and Human Nature as the bride glowing
with desire for union with God. Maeterlinck
feels too modernly to make use of that ancient
sensuous imagery. The main thesis of his mystical
belief is that there are divine forces dormant
in human nature; how to arouse and release them,
constitutes the paramount problem of human life.
His doctrine is that a life not thus energized by its
own latent divineness is, and must remain, humdrum
and worthless. It will at once be noticed
that such a doctrine harmonizes thoroughly with
the romantic aspiration. Both mystic and romantic
teach that, in the last resort, the battlefield
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>
of our fate lies not out in the wide world but that
it is enclosed in the inner self, within the unknown
quantity which we designate as our soul. The visible
life, according to this modern prophet of mysticism,
obeys the invisible; happiness and unhappiness
flow exclusively from the inner sources.</p>

<p>Maeterlinck's speculations, despite their medieval
provenience, have a practical orientation. He
firmly believes that it is within the ability of mankind
to raise some of the veils that cover life's central
secret. In unison with some other charitable
students of society, he holds to the faith that a
more highly spiritualized era is dawning, and from
the observed indications he prognosticates a wider
awakening of the sleepbound soul of man. And
certainly some of the social manifestations that
appeared with cumulative force during the constructive
period before the war were calculated to
justify that faith. The revival of interest in the
metaphysical powers of man which expressed itself
almost epidemically through such widely divergent
cults as Theosophy and Christian Science,
was indubitable proof of spiritual yearnings in the
broader masses of the people. And it had a practical
counterpart in civic tendencies and reforms
that evidenced a great agitation of the social conscience.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
And even to-day, when the great majority
feel that the universal embroilment has caused
civilized man to fall from his laboriously achieved
level, this sage in his lofty solitude feels the redeeming
spiritual connotation of our great calamity.
&ldquo;Humanity was ready to rise above itself,
to surpass all that it had hitherto accomplished.
It has surpassed it&hellip;. Never before had nations
been seen that were able as a whole to understand
that the happiness of each of those who live
in this time of trial is of no consequence compared
with the honor of those who live no more or the
happiness of those who are not yet alive. We stand
on heights that had not been attained before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even for those many who find themselves
unable to build very large hopes on the spiritual
uplift of mankind through disaster, Maeterlinck's
philosophy is a wholesome tonic. In the
essay on &ldquo;The Life Profound&rdquo; in &ldquo;The Treasure
of the Humble,&rdquo; we are told: &ldquo;Every man must
find for himself in the low and unavoidable reality
of common life his special possibility of a higher
existence.&rdquo; The injunction, trite though it sound,
articulates a moral very far from philistine. For
it urges the pursuit of the transcendental self
through those feelings which another very great
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
idealist, Friedrich Schiller, describes in magnificent
metaphor as</p>

<div class="poetry italic width18" lang="de" xml:lang="de">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&hellip;&nbsp;&ldquo;der dunklen Gefühle Gewalt,<br/></div>
<div class="line">die im Herzen wunderbar schliefen.&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In the labyrinth of the subliminal consciousness
there lurks, however, a great danger for the seeker
after the hidden treasures: the paralyzing effect
of fatalism upon the normal energies. Maeterlinck
was seriously threatened by this danger
during his earlier period. How he eventually
contrived his liberation from the clutch of fatalism
is not made entirely clear by the progress of
his thought. At all events, an era of greater intellectual
freedom, which ultimately was to create
him the undisputed captain of his soul and
master of his fate, was soon to arrive for him. It
is heralded by another book of essays: &ldquo;Wisdom
and Destiny.&rdquo; But, as has been stated, we may
in his case hardly hope to trace the precise route
traveled by the mind between the points of departure
and arrival.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>So closely are the vital convictions in this truthful
writer linked with the artistic traits of his work
that without some grasp of his metaphysics even
the technical peculiarities of his plays cannot be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>
fully appreciated. To the mystic temper of mind,
all life is secretly pregnant with great meaning,
so that none of its phenomena can be deemed inconsequential.
Thus, while Maeterlinck is a poet
greatly preoccupied with spiritual matters yet
nothing to him is more wonderful and worthy of
attention than the bare facts and processes of
living. Real life, just like the theatre which
purports to represent it, manipulates a multiform
assortment of stage effects, now coarse and obvious
and claptrap, now refined and esoteric, to suit
the diversified taste and capacity of the patrons.
To the cultured esthetic sense the tragical tendency
carries more meaning than the catastrophic finale;
our author accordingly scorns, and perhaps inordinately,
whatsoever may appear as merely adventitious
in the action of plays. &ldquo;What can be told,&rdquo;
he exclaims, &ldquo;by beings who are possessed of a
fixed idea and have no time to live because they
have to kill off a rival or a mistress?&rdquo; The internalized
action in his plays is all of one piece with
the profound philosophical conviction that the
inner life alone matters; that consequently the
small and unnoticed events are more worthy of attention
than the sensational, cataclysmic moments.
&ldquo;Why wait ye,&rdquo; he asks in that wonderful rhapsody
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
on &ldquo;Silence&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> &ldquo;for Heaven to open at the
strike of the thunderbolt? Ye should attend upon
the blessed hours when it silently opens&mdash;and it is
incessantly opening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His purpose, then, is to reveal the working of
hidden forces in their intricate and inseparable
connection with external events; and in order that
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie intérieure</i> might have the right of way,
drama in his practice emancipates itself very far
from the traditional realistic methods. &ldquo;Poetry,&rdquo;
he maintains, &ldquo;has no other purpose than to keep
open the great roads that lead from the visible
to the invisible.&rdquo; To be sure, this definition postulates,
rather audaciously, a widespread spiritual
susceptibility. But in Maeterlinck's optimistic
anthropology no human being is spiritually so
deadened as to be forever out of all communication
with the things that are divine and infinite.
He fully realizes, withal, that for the great mass
of men there exists no intellectual approach to
the truly significant problems of life. It is rather
through our emotional capacity that our spiritual
experience brings us into touch with the final verities.
Anyway, the poet of mysticism appeals from
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">impasse</i> of pure reasoning to the voice of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
inner oracles. But how to detect in the deepest
recesses of the soul the echoes of universal life
and give outward resonance to their faint reverberations?
That is the artistic, and largely technical,
side of the problem.</p>

<p>Obvious it is that if the beholder's collaboration
in the difficult enterprise is to be secured, his
imagination has to be stirred to a super-normal
degree. Once a dramatist has succeeded in stimulating
the imaginative activity, he can dispense
with a mass of descriptive detail. But he must
comply with two irremissible technical demands.
In the first place, the &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie intérieure</i>&rdquo; calls forth
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dialogue intérieur</i>; an esoteric language, I would
say, contrived predominantly for the &ldquo;expressional&rdquo;
functions of speech, as differenced from its
&ldquo;impressional&rdquo; purposes. Under Swedenborg's
fanciful theory of &ldquo;correspondences&rdquo; the literal
meaning of a word is merely a sort of protective
husk for its secret spiritual kernel. It is this inner,
essential meaning that Maeterlinck's dialogue
attempts to set free. By a fairly simple and consistent
code of intimations the underlying meaning
of the colloquy is laid bare and a basis created
for a more fundamental understanding of the
dramatic transactions. Maeterlinck going, at first,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>
to undue lengths in this endeavor, exposed the diction
of his dramas to much cheap ridicule. The
extravagant use of repetition, in particular, made
him a mark for facile burlesque. The words of
the Queen in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Princesse Maleine</i>: &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais ne répetez
pas toujours ce que l'on dit</i>,&rdquo; were sarcastically
turned against the poet himself.</p>

<p>As a result of the extreme simplicity of his dialogue,
Maeterlinck was reproached with having
invented the &ldquo;monosyllabic theatre,&rdquo; the &ldquo;theatre
without words,&rdquo; and with having perpetrated
a surrogate sort of drama, a hybrid between
libretto and pantomime.</p>

<p>The fact, however, is, his characters speak a
language which, far from being absurd, as it was
at first thought to be by many of his readers, is
instinct with life and quite true to life&mdash;to life,
that is, as made articulate in the intense privacy of
dreams, or hallucinations, or moments of excessive
emotional perturbation.</p>

<p>The other principal requisite for the attainment
of the inner dramatic vitalness in drama is a pervasive
atmospheric mood, a sustained <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Stimmung</i>.
This, in the case of Maeterlinck, is brought about
by the combined employment of familiar and
original artistic devices.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>The grave and melancholy mood that so deeply
impregnates the work of Maeterlinck is tinged in
the earlier stage, as has been pointed out, with the
sombre coloring of fatalism. In the first few
books, in particular, there hovers a brooding sense
of terror and an undefinable feeling of desolation.
Through <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Serres Chaudes</i> (&ldquo;Hot Houses&rdquo;), his
first published book, (1889), there runs a tenor
of weariness, of ideal yearnings overshadowed by
the hopelessness of circumstances. Even in this
collection of poems, where so much less necessity
exists for a unity of mood than in the plays, Maeterlinck's
predilection for scenic effects suggestive
of weirdness and superstitious fear became apparent
in the recurrent choice of sombre scenic motifs:
oppressive nocturnal silence,&mdash;a stagnant sheet of
water,&mdash;moonlight filtered through green windows,
etc. The diction, too, through the incessant
use of terms like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morne</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">las</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâle</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">désire</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tiède</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">indolent</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malade</i>, exhales as it were a
lazy resignation. Temporarily, then, the fatalistic
strain is uppermost both in the philosophy
and the poetry of the rising young author; and
to make matters worse, his is the fatalism of pessimistic
despair: Fate is forsworn against man.
The objective point of life is death. We constantly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>
receive warnings from within, but the
voices are not unequivocal and emphatic enough to
save us from ourselves.</p>

<p>Probing the abysses of his subliminal self, the
mystic may sense, along with the diviner promptings
of the heart, the lurking demons that undermine
happiness,&mdash;&ldquo;the malignant powers,&rdquo;&mdash;again
quoting Schiller&mdash;&ldquo;whom no man's craft can make
familiar&rdquo;&mdash;that element in human nature which
in truth makes man &ldquo;his own worst enemy.&rdquo; It
is a search which at this stage of his development
Maeterlinck, as a mystic, cannot bring himself to
relinquish, even though, pessimistically, he anticipates
that which he most dreads to find; in this
way, fatalism and pessimism act as insuperable
barriers against his artistic self-assertion. His
fixed frame of mind confines him to the representation
of but one elemental instinct, namely, that of
fear. The rustic in the German fairy tale who
sallied forth to learn how to shudder,&mdash;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gruseln</i>,&mdash;would
have mastered the art to his complete satisfaction
if favored with a performance or two of
such plays as &ldquo;Princess Maleine,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Intruder,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;The Sightless.&rdquo; Perhaps no other dramatist
has ever commanded a similarly well-equipped arsenal
of thrills and terrible foreshadowings. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
commonest objects are fraught with ominous forebodings:
a white gown lying on a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prie-dieu</i>, a curtain
suddenly set swaying by a puff of air, the melancholy
soughing of a clump of trees,&mdash;the simplest
articles of daily use are converted into awful
symbols that make us shiver by their whisperings
of impending doom.</p>

<p>Nor in the earlier products of Maeterlinck are
the cruder practices of melodrama scorned or
spared,&mdash;the crash and flash of thunder and lightning,
the clang of bells and clatter of chains, the
livid light and ghastly shadows, the howling hurricane,
the ominous croaking of ravens amid nocturnal
solitude, trees illumined by the fiery eyes of
owls, bats whirring portentously through the
gloom,&mdash;so many harbingers of dread and death.
And the prophetic import of these tokens and their
sort is reinforced by repeated assertions from the
persons in the action that never before has anything
like this been known to occur. To such a
fearsome state are we wrought up by all this uncanny
apparatus that at the critical moment a well
calculated knock at the door is sufficient to make
our flesh creep and our hair stand on end.</p>

<p>Thus, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie intérieure</i> would seem to prerequire
for its externalization a completely furnished
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>
chamber of horrors. And when it is added that
the scene of the action is by preference a lonely
churchyard or a haunted old mansion, a crypt, a
cavern, a silent forest or a solitary tower, it is
easy to understand why plays like &ldquo;Princess Maleine&rdquo;
could be classed by superficial and unfriendly
critics with the gruesome ebullitions of that
fantastic quasi-literary occupation to which we
owe a well known variety of &ldquo;water-front&rdquo; drama
and, in fiction, the &ldquo;shilling shocker.&rdquo; Their immeasurably
greater psychological refinement could
not save them later on from condemnation at the
hands of their own maker. And yet they are not
without very great artistic merits. Octave Mirbeau,
in his habitual enthusiasm for the out-of-the-ordinary,
hailed Maeterlinck, on the strength of
&ldquo;Princess Maleine,&rdquo; as the Belgian Shakespeare,
evidently because Maeterlinck derived some of his
motifs from &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;: mainly the churchyard
scene, and Prince Hjalmar's defiance of the queen,
as well as his general want of decision. As a matter
of fact, Maeterlinck has profoundly studied,
not Shakespeare alone, but the minor Elizabethans
as well. He has made an admirable translation
of &ldquo;Macbeth.&rdquo; Early in his career he even
translated one of John Ford's Plays, &ldquo;'Tis Pity
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
She's a Whore,&rdquo; one of the coarsest works ever
written for the stage, but to which he was attracted
by the intrinsic human interest that far outweighs
its offensiveness. As for any real kinship
of Maeterlinck with Shakespeare, the resemblance
between the two is slight. They differ philosophically
in the fundamental frame of mind, ethically
in the outlook upon life, dramaturgically in the
value attached to external action, and humanly,&mdash;much
to the disadvantage of the Belgian,&mdash;in their
sense of humor. For unfortunately it has to be
confessed that this supreme gift of the gods has
been very sparingly dispensed to Maeterlinck. Altogether,
whether or no he is to be counted among
the disciples of Shakespeare, his works show no
great dependence on the master. With far better
reason might he be called a debtor to Germanic
folklore, especially in its fantastic elements.</p>

<p>A German fairy world it is to which we are
transported by Maeterlinck's first dramatic attempt,
&ldquo;Princess Maleine,&rdquo; (1889), a play refashioned
after Grimm's tale of the Maid Maleen;
only that in the play all the principals come to a
harrowing end and that in it an esoteric meaning
lies concealed underneath the primitive plot. The
action, symbolically interpreted, illustrates the fatalist's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>
doctrine that man is nothing but a toy in
the hands of dark and dangerous powers. Practical
wisdom does not help us to discern the working
of these powers until it is too late. Neither
can we divine their presence, for the prophetic apprehension
of the future resides not in the expert
and proficient, but rather in the helpless or decrepit,&mdash;the
blind, the feeble-minded, and the
stricken in years, or again in young children and in
dumb animals. Take the scene in &ldquo;Princess Maleine&rdquo;
where the murderers, having invaded the
chamber, lie there in wait, with bated breath. In
the corridor outside, people are unconcernedly
passing to and fro, while the only creatures who,
intuitively, sense the danger, are the little Prince
and a dog that keeps anxiously scraping at the
door.</p>

<p>In <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Intruse</i> (&ldquo;The Intruder&rdquo;), (1890), a one-act
play on a theme which is collaterally developed
later on in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Aveugles</i> (&ldquo;The Sightless&rdquo;), and
in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Intérieur</i> (&ldquo;Home&rdquo;), the arriving disaster
that cannot be shut out by bolts or bars announces
itself only to the clairvoyant sense of a blind old
man. The household gathered around the table is
placidly waiting for the doctor. Only the blind
grandfather is anxious and heavy-laden because he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>
alone knows that Death is entering the house, he
alone can feel his daughter's life withering away
under the breath of the King of Terror: the sightless
have a keener sensitiveness than the seeing
for what is screened from the physical eye.</p>

<p>It would hardly be possible to name within the
whole range of dramatic literature another work
so thoroughly pervaded with the chilling horror
of approaching calamity. The talk at the table is
of the most commonplace,&mdash;that the door will not
shut properly, and they must send for the carpenter
to-morrow. But from the mechanism of
the environment there comes cumulative and incremental
warning that something extraordinary and
fatal is about to happen. The wind rises, the
trees shiver, the nightingales break off their singing,
the fishes in the pond grow restive, the dogs
cower in fear,&mdash;an unseen Presence walks through
the garden. Then the clanging of a scythe is
heard. A cold current of air rushes into the room.
Nearer and nearer come the steps. The grandfather
insists that a stranger has seated himself
in the midst of the family. The lamp goes out.
The bell strikes midnight. The old man is sure
that somebody is rising from the table. Then
suddenly the baby whose voice has never been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
heard starts crying. Through an inner door steps
a deaconess silently crossing herself: the mother
of the house is dead.</p>

<p>These incidents in themselves are not necessarily
miraculous. There are none of them but
might be accounted for on perfectly natural
grounds. In fact, very plausible explanations do
offer themselves for the weirdest things that come
to pass. So, especially, it was a real, ordinary
mower that chanced to whet his scythe; yet the
apparition of the Old Reaper in person could not
cause the chilling consternation produced by this
trivial circumstance coming as it does as the climax
of a succession of commonplace happenings exaggerated
and distorted by a fear-haunted imagination.
To produce an effect like that upon
an audience whose credulity refuses to be put to
any undue strain is a victorious proof of prime
artistic ability.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Aveugles</i> (&ldquo;The Sightless&rdquo;), (1891), is
pitched in the same psychological key. The atmosphere
is surcharged with unearthly apprehension.
A dreary twilight&mdash;in the midst of a
thick forest&mdash;on a lonely island; twelve blind
people fretting about the absence of their guardian.
He is gone to find a way out of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>
woods&mdash;what can have become of him? From
moment to moment the deserted, helpless band
grows more fearstricken. The slightest sound becomes
the carrier of evil forebodings: the rustling
of the foliage, the flapping of a bird's wings,
the swelling roar of the nearby sea in its dash
against the shore. The bell strikes twelve&mdash;they
wonder is it noon or night? Then questions, eager
and calamitous, pass in whispers among them:
Has the leader lost his way? Will he never come
back? Has the dam burst apart and will they all
be swallowed by the ocean? The pathos is greatly
heightened by an extremely delicate yet sure individuation
of the figures, as when at the mention of
Heaven those not sightless from birth raise their
countenance to the sky. And where in the meanwhile
is the lost leader? He is seated right in their
midst, but smitten by death. They learn it at last
through the actions of the dog; besides whom&mdash;in
striking parallel to &ldquo;Princess Maleine&rdquo;&mdash;the only
other creature able to see is a little child. The horror-stricken
unfortunates realize that they can
never get home, and that they must perish in the
woods.</p>

<p>In <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Sept Princesses</i> (&ldquo;The Seven Princesses&rdquo;),
(1891), although it is one of Maeterlinck's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
minor achievements, some of the qualities
that are common to all his work become peculiarly
manifest. This is particularly true of the skill
shown in conveying the feeling of the story by
means of suitable scenic devices. Most of his
plays depend to a considerable degree for their
dark and heavy nimbus of unreality upon a studied
combination of paraphernalia in themselves
neither numerous nor far-sought. In fact, the resulting
scenic repertory, too, is markedly limited:
a weird forest, a deserted castle with marble staircase
and dreamy moonlit terrace, a tower with
vaulted dungeons, a dismal corridor flanked by impenetrable
chambers, a lighted interior viewed
from the garden, a landscape bodefully crêped
with twilight&mdash;the list nearly exhausts his store
of &ldquo;sets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The works mentioned so far are hardly more
than able exercises preparatory for the ampler
and more finished products which were to succeed
them. Yet they represent signal steps in the evolution
of a new dramatic style, designed, as has
already been intimated, to give palpable form to
emotional data descried in moments anterior not
only to articulation but even to consciousness itself;
and for this reason, the plane of the dramatic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
action lies deep below the surface of life, down in
the inner tabernacle where the mystic looks for the
hidden destinies. In his style, Maeterlinck had
gradually developed an unprecedented capacity for
bringing to light the secret agencies of fate. A
portion of the instructed public had already
learned to listen in his writings for the finer reverberations
that swing in the wake of the uttered
phrase, to heed the slightest hints and allusions in
the text, to overlook no glance or gesture that
might betray the mind of the acting characters.
It is true that art to be great must be plain, but
that does not mean that the sole test of great art
is the response of the simple and apathetic.</p>

<p>In Maeterlinck's first masterpiece, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pélléas et
Mélisande</i>, (1892), the motives again are drawn
up from the lower regions of consciousness; once
more the plot is born of a gloomy fancy, and the
darkling mood hovering over scene and action
attests the persistence of fatalism in the poet. The
theory of old King Arkel, the spokesman of the
author's personal philosophy, is that one should
not seek to be active; one should ever wait on
the threshold of Fate. Even the younger people
in the play are infected by the morbid doctrine of
an inevitable necessity for all things that happen
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>
to them: &ldquo;We do not go where we would go.
We do not do that which we would do.&rdquo; Perhaps,
however, these beliefs are here enounced for the
last time with the author's assent or acquiescence.</p>

<p>In artistic merit &ldquo;Pélléas and Mélisande&rdquo; marks
a nearer approach to mastery, once the integral
peculiarities of the form and method have been
granted. Despite a noticeable lack of force, directness,
and plasticity in the characterization, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie intérieure</i> is most convincingly expressed. In
one of the finest scenes of the play we see the principals
at night gazing out upon a measureless expanse
of water dotted with scattered lights. The
atmosphere is permeated with a reticent yearning
of love. The two young creatures, gentle, shy,
their souls tinged with melancholy, are drawn towards
one another by an ineluctable mutual attraction.
Yet, though their hearts are filled to
overflowing, not a word of affection is uttered.
Their love reveals itself to us even as to themselves,
without a loud and jarring declaration,
through its very speechlessness, as it were. The
situation well bears out the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roi sage</i> in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alladine
et Palomides</i>: &ldquo;There is a moment when souls
touch one another and know everything without
a need of our opening the lips.&rdquo; There are still
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
other scenes in this play so tense with emotion that
words would be intrusive and dissonant. There is
that lovely picture of Mélisande at the window;
Pélléas cannot reach up to her hand, but is satisfied
to feel her loosened hair about his face. It
is a question whether even that immortal love duet
in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; casts a poetic spell more
enchanting than this. At another moment in the
drama, we behold the lovers in Maeterlinck's beloved
half-light, softly weeping as they stare with
speechless rapture into the flames. And not until
the final parting does any word of love pass their
lips. In another part of the play Goland, Mélisande's
aging husband, who suspects his young
stepbrother, Pélléas, of loving Mélisande, conducts
him to an underground chamber. We are
not told why he has brought him there, and why
he has led him to the brink of the pitfall from
which there mounts a smell of death. If it be a
heinous deed he is brooding, why does he pause in
its execution? His terrible struggle does not reveal
itself through speech, yet it is eloquently expressed
in the wildness of his looks, the trembling of his
voice, and the sudden anguished outcry: &ldquo;Pélléas!
Pélléas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently Maeterlinck completely achieves the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
very purpose to which the so-called Futurists think
they must sacrifice all traditional conceptions of
Art; and achieves it without any brutal stripping
and skinning of the poetic subject, without the
hideous exhibition of its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra</i>, and
above all, without that implied disqualification for
the higher artistic mission which alone could induce
a man to limit his service to the dishing-up of
chunks and collops, &ldquo;cubic&rdquo; or amorphous.</p>

<p>In recognition of a certain tendency towards
mannerism that lay in his technique, Maeterlinck,
in a spirit of self-persiflage, labeled the book of
one-act plays which he next published, (1894),
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois Petits Drames pour Marionettes</i> (&ldquo;Three
Little Puppet Plays&rdquo;). They are entitled, severally:
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alladine et Palomides</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Intérieur</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Mort de Tintagiles</i>. While in motifs and materials
as well as in the principal points of style
these playlets present a sort of epitome of his artistic
progression up to date, they also display some
new and significant qualities. Of the three the
first named is most replete with suggestive symbolism
and at the same time most remindful of
the older plays, especially of &ldquo;Pélléas and Mélisande.&rdquo;
King Ablamore is in character and demeanor
clearly a counterpart of King Arkel. To
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>
be sure he makes a temporary stand against the
might of Fate, but his resistance is meek and futile,
and his wisdom culminates in the same old
fatalistic formula: &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je sais qu'on ne fait pas ce
que l'on voudrait faire.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Intérieur</i> (&ldquo;Home&rdquo;) handles a theme almost
identical with that of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Intruse</i>: Life and Death
separated only by a thin pane of glass,&mdash;the sudden
advent of affliction from a cloudless sky. In
this little tragedy a family scene, enacted in &ldquo;dumb
show,&rdquo; is watched from the outside. The play is
without suspense in the customary use of the term,
since after the first whispered conversation between
the bringers of the fateful tidings the audience
is fully aware of the whole story:&mdash;the
daughter of the house, for whose return the little
group is waiting, has been found dead in the river.
The quiescent mood is sustained to the end; no
great outburst of lamentation; the curtain drops
the instant the news has been conveyed. But the
poignancy of the tragic strain is only enhanced
by the repression of an exciting climax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Death of Tintagiles&rdquo; repeats in a still
more harrowing form the fearful predicament of
a helpless child treated with so much dramatic
tension in Maeterlinck's first tragedy. Again, as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
in &ldquo;Princess Maleine,&rdquo; the action of this dramolet
attains its high point in a scene where murderous
treachery is about to spring the trap set for
an innocent young prince. Intuitively he senses
the approach of death, and in vain beats his little
fists against the door that imprisons him. The
situation is rendered more piteous even than in
the earlier treatment of the motif, because the
door which bars his escape also prevents his faithful
sister Ygraine from coming to the rescue.</p>

<p>We have observed in all the plays so far a
marked simplicity of construction. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aglavaine et
Selysette</i>, (1896), denotes a still further simplification.
Here the scenic apparatus is reduced to the
very minimum, and the psychological premises are
correspondingly plain. The story presents a &ldquo;triangular&rdquo;
love entanglement strangely free from
the sensual ingredient; two women dream of sharing,
in all purity, one lover&mdash;and the dream ends
for one of them in heroic self-sacrifice brought to
secure the happiness of the rival. However, more
noteworthy than the structure of the plot is the
fact that the philosophic current flowing through it
has perceptibly altered its habitual direction. The
spiritual tendency is felt to be turning in its course,
and even though fatalism still holds the rule, with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
slowly relaxing grip, yet a changed ethical outlook
is manifest. Also, this play for the first time
proclaims, though in no vociferous manner, the
duty of the individual toward himself, the duty so
emphatically proclaimed by two of Maeterlinck's
greatest teachers, Ralph Waldo Emerson and
Henrik Ibsen.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The inner philosophic conflict was but of short
duration. In 1898 <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Sagesse et La Destinée</i>
(&ldquo;Wisdom and Destiny&rdquo;) saw the light. The
metaphor might be taken in a meaning higher and
more precise than the customary, for, coming to
this book from those that preceded is indeed like
emerging from some dark and dismal cave into
the warm and cheering light of the sun. &ldquo;Wisdom
and Destiny&rdquo; is a collection of essays and aphorisms
which stands to this second phase of Maeterlinck's
dramaturgy in a relation closely analogous
to that existing between &ldquo;The Treasure of the
Humble&rdquo; and the works heretofore surveyed.
Without amounting to a wholesale recantation of
the idea that is central in the earlier set of essays,
the message of the newer set is of a very different
kind. The author of &ldquo;Wisdom and Destiny&rdquo; has
not changed his view touching the superiority of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>
the intuitional function over the intellectual. The
significant difference between the old belief and
the new consists simply in this: the latent force of
life is no longer imagined as an antagonistic
agency; rather it is conceived as a benign energy
that makes for a serene acceptance of the world
that is. Of this turn in the outlook, the philosophic
affirmation of life and the consent of the
will to subserve the business of living are the salutary
concomitants. Wisdom, in expanding, has
burst the prison of fatalism and given freedom to
vision. The world, beheld in the light of this
emancipation, is not to be shunned by the wise
man. Let Fortune bring what she will, he can
strip his afflictions of their terrors by transmuting
them into higher knowledge. Therefore, pain
and suffering need not be feared and shirked; they
may even be hailed with satisfaction, for, as is
paradoxically suggested in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aglavaine et Selysette</i>,
they help man &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être heureux en devenant plus
triste</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;to be happy in becoming sadder. The
poet, who till now had clung to the conviction that
there can be no happy fate, that all our destinies
are guided by unlucky stars, now on the contrary
persuades us to consider how even calamity may
be refined in the medium of wisdom in such fashion
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
as to become an asset of life, and warns us
against recoiling in spirit from any reverse of
our fortunes. He holds that blows and sorrows
cannot undo the sage. Fate has no weapons save
those we supply, and &ldquo;wise is he for whom even
the evil must feed the pyre of love.&rdquo; In fine, Fate
obeys him who dares to command it. After all,
then, man has a right to appoint himself the captain
of his soul, the master of his fate.</p>

<p>Yet, for all that, the author of &ldquo;Wisdom and
Destiny&rdquo; should not be regarded as the partizan
and apologist of sadness for the sake of wisdom.
If sorrow be a rich mine of satisfaction, joy is by
far the richer mine. This new outlook becomes
more and more optimistic because of the increasing
faculty of such a philosophy to extract from
the mixed offerings of life a more near-at-hand
happiness than sufferings can possibly afford; not
perchance that perpetual grinning merriment over
the comicality of the passing spectacle which with
so many passes for a &ldquo;sense of humor,&rdquo; but rather
a calm and serious realization of what is lastingly
beautiful, good, and true. A person's attainment
of this beatitude imposes on him the clear duty of
helping others to rise to a similar exalted level of
existence. And this duty Maeterlinck seeks to discharge
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
by proclaiming in jubilant accents the concrete
reality of happiness. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Oiseau Bleu</i> (&ldquo;The
Blue Bird&rdquo;), above all other works, illustrates the
fact that human lives suffer not so much for the
lack of happiness as for the want of being clearly
conscious of the happiness they possess. It is seen
that the seed of optimism in &ldquo;The Treasure of
the Humble&rdquo; has sprouted and spread out, and at
last triumphantly shot forth through the overlaying
fatalism. The newly converted, hence all the
more thoroughgoing, optimist, believing that counsel
and consolation can come only from those who
trust in the regenerative power of hope, throws
himself into a mental attitude akin to that of the
Christian Scientist, and confidently proceeds to
cure the ills of human kind by a categorical denial
of their existence. Or perhaps it would be more
just to say of Maeterlinck's latter-day outlook, the
serenity of which even the frightful experience of
the present time has failed to destroy, that instead
of peremptorily negating evil, he merely denies
its supremacy. All about him he perceives in
the midst of the worst wrongs and evils many
fertile germs of righteousness; vice itself seems to
distil its own antitoxin.</p>

<p>Together with Maeterlinck's optimistic strain,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
his individualism gains an unexpected emphasis.
&ldquo;Before one exists for others, one must exist for
one's self. The egoism of a strong and clear-sighted
soul is of a more beneficent effect than all
the devotion of a blind and feeble soul.&rdquo; Here we
have a promulgation identical in gist with Emerson's
unqualified declaration of moral independence
when he says: &ldquo;Whoso would be a man must
be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal
palms must not be hindered by the name of
goodness, but must explore if it be goodness.
Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your
own mind. No law can be sacred to me but that
of my nature.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">(8)</a></p>

<p>His attitude of countenancing the positive joys
of living causes Maeterlinck in his later career to
reverse his former judgment, and to inveigh, much
in the manner of Nietzsche, against the &ldquo;parasitical
virtues.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certain notions about resignation
and self-sacrifice sap the finest moral forces of
mankind more thoroughly than do great vices and
even crimes. The alleged triumphs over the flesh
are in most cases only complete defeats of life.&rdquo;
When to such rebellious sentiments is joined an explicit
warning against the seductions and intimidations
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
held out by the official religions&mdash;their sugar
plums and dog whips, as Maeterlinck puts it&mdash;one
can only wonder how his writings escaped as long
as they did the attention of the authorities that
swing the power of imprimatur and anathema.</p>

<p>Maeterlinck may not be classed unreservedly
as a radical individualist. For whereas a philosophy
like that of Nietzsche takes no account of the
&ldquo;much-too-many,&rdquo; who according to that great
fantasist do not interest anybody except the statistician
and the devil, Maeterlinck realizes the
supreme importance of the great mass as the ordained
transmitters of civilization. The gulf between
aristocratic subjectivism, devoted single-mindedly
to the ruthless enforcement of self-interest,
and, on the other hand, a self-forgetful social
enthusiasm, is bridged in Maeterlinck by an
extremely strong instinct for justice and, moreover,
by his firm belief&mdash;at least for the time being&mdash;that
the same strong instinct exists universally
as a specific trait of human nature. By such a
philosophy Justice, then, is discerned not as a
supra-natural function, but as a function of human
nature as distinguished from nature at large. The
restriction is made necessary by our knowledge of
the observable operations of nature. In particular
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
would the principle of heredity seem to argue
against the reign of justice in the administration
of human destinies, inasmuch as we find ourselves
quite unable to recognize in the apportionment of
pleasure and pain anything like a due ratio of
merit. And yet Maeterlinck realizes that perhaps
nature measures life with a larger standard
than the individual's short span of existence, and
warns us in his essay on &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; not to indulge
our self-conceit in a specious emulation of ways
that are utterly beyond our comprehension. After
all, then, our poet-philosopher succeeds <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foro conscientiæ</i>
in reconciling his cult of self with devotion
to the common interest. Morality, in that
essay, is defined as the co-ordination of personal
desire to the task assigned by nature to the race.
And is it not true that a contrary, that is, ascetic
concept of morality reduces itself to absurdity
through its antagonism to that primal human instinct
that makes for the continuity of life?</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>From the compromise effected between two
fairly opposite ethical principles, there emerges
in the works of this period something akin to a
socialistic tendency. It is organically related to
the mystical prepossession of the author's manner
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>
of thinking. Maeterlinck gratefully acknowledges
that by the search-light of science the uppermost
layers of darkness have been dispelled; but realizes
also that the deep-seated central enigma still
remains in darkness: as much as ever are the primordial
causes sealed against a glimpse of finite
knowledge. We have changed the names, not the
problems. Instead of God, Providence, or Fate,
we say Nature, Selection, and Heredity. But in
reality do we know more concerning Life than did
our ancestors?</p>

<p>What, then, questions the persevering pursuer
of the final verities, shall we do in order that we
may press nearer to Truth? May we not perchance
steep our souls in light that flows from
another source than science? And what purer
light is there to illumine us than the halo surrounding
a contented worker performing his task,
not under coercion, but from a voluntary, or it
may be instinctive, submission to the law of life?
If such subordination of self constitutes the basis
of rational living, we shall do well to study its
workings on a lowlier and less complicated plane
than the human; for instance, in the behavior of
the creature that is proverbial for its unflagging
industry. For this industry is not motivated by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>
immediate or selfish wants; it springs from instinctive
self-dedication to the common cause.
Some people expected from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vie des Abeilles</i>
(&ldquo;The Life of the Bee&rdquo;), (1901), much brand-new
information about matters of apiculture. But
in spite of his twenty-five years' experience, Maeterlinck
had no startling discoveries to convey to
his fellow-hivers. His book on bees is not primarily
the result of a specialist's investigations but
a poetical record of the observations made by a
mind at once romantic and philosophical and
strongly attracted to the study of this particular
form of community life, because by its organization
on a miniature scale it spreads before the
student of society a synoptic view of human affairs.</p>

<p>Of the great change that had by now taken
place in his conception of life, Maeterlinck was
fully cognizant, and made no concealment of it.
In the essay on &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; he says, with reference
to his earlier dramas: &ldquo;The motive of these little
plays was the fear of the Unknown by which we
are constantly surrounded,&rdquo; and passes on to describe
his religious temper as a sort of compound
of the Christian idea of God with the antique idea
of Fate, immersed in the profound gloom of hopeless
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
mystery. &ldquo;The Unknown took chiefly the
aspect of a power, itself but blindly groping in
the dark, yet disposing with inexorable unfeelingness
of the fates of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently those same plays are passed once
more in self-critical review in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ardiane et Barbe-Bleue</i>
(&ldquo;Ardiane and Blue-Beard&rdquo;), (1899), notwithstanding
the fact that the author disclaims
any philosophic purpose and presents his work as
a mere libretto. We cannot regard it as purely
accidental that of Blue-Beard's terror-stricken
wives, four,&mdash;Selysette, Mélisande, Ygraine, Alladine,&mdash;bear
the names of earlier heroines, and,
besides, that each of these retains with the name
also the character of her namesake. The symbolism
is too transparent. The child-wives of the cruel
knight, forever in a state of trembling fear, are
too passive to extricate themselves from their fate,
whereas Ardiane succeeds instantly in breaking
her captivity, because she has the spirit and
strength to shatter the window and let in the light
and air. The contrast between her resolute personality
and those five inert bundles of misery undoubtedly
connotes the difference between the author's
paralyzing fatalism in the past and his present
dynamic optimism.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>A like contrast between dejection and resilience
would be brought to light by a comparison of the
twelve lyric poems, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Douze Chansons</i>, (1897),
with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Serres Chaudes</i>. The mood is still greatly
subdued; the new poetry is by no means free
from sadness and a strain of resignation. But the
half-stifled despair that cries out from the older
book returns no dissonant echo in the new.</p>

<p>Even his dramatic technique comes under the
sway of Maeterlinck's altered view of the world.
The far freer use of exciting and eventful action
testifies to increased elasticity and force. This is
a marked feature of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">S&oelig;ur Beatrice</i> (&ldquo;Sister
Beatrice&rdquo;), (1900), a miracle play founded on
the old story about the recreant nun who, broken
from sin and misery, returns to the cloister and
finds that during the many years of her absence
her part and person have been carried out by
the Holy Virgin herself.</p>

<p>Equally, the three other dramas of this epoch&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aglavaine
et Selysette</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monna Vanna</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Joyzelle</i>&mdash;are
highly available for scenic enactment.
Of the three, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monna Vanna</i>, (1902), in particular
is conspicuous for a wholly unexpected aptitude
of characterization, and for the unsurpassed
intensity of its situations, which in this isolated
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
case are not cast in a single mood as in the other
plays, but are individually distinct and full of
dramatic progress, whereas everywhere else the
action moves rather sluggishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monna Vanna&rdquo; is one of the most brilliantly
actable plays of modern times, despite its improbability.
A certain incongruity between the
realistic and the romantic aspects in the behavior
of the principals is saved from offensiveness by
a disposition on the part of the spectator to refer
it, unhistorically, to the provenience of the story.
But as a matter of fact the actors are not fifteenth
century Renaissance men and women at all, but
mystics, modern mystics at that, both in their reasoning
and their morality. It is under a cryptical
soul-compulsion that Giovanna goes forth to the
unknown condottiere prepared to lay down her
honor for the salvation of her people, and that
her husband at last conquers his repugnance to her
going. Prinzivalle, Guido, Marco, are mystics
even to a higher degree than Vanna.</p>

<p>The poignant actualism of &ldquo;Monna Vanna&rdquo;
lies, however, in the author's frank sympathy with
a distinctively modern zest for freedom. The
situation between husband and wife is reminiscent
of &ldquo;A Doll's House&rdquo; in the greedily possessive
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>
quality of Guido's affection, with which quality
his tyrannous unbelief in Prinzivalle's magnanimity
fully accords. But Maeterlinck here goes
a step beyond Ibsen. In her married life with
Guido, Vanna was meekly contented, &ldquo;at least as
happy as one can be when one has renounced the
vague and extravagant dreams which seem beyond
human life.&rdquo; When the crisis arrives she
realizes that &ldquo;it is never too late for one who has
found a love that can fill a life.&rdquo; Her final rebellion
is sanctioned by the author, who unmistakably
endorses the venerable Marco's profession
of faith that life is always in the right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joyzelle,&rdquo; (1903), inferior to &ldquo;Monna Vanna&rdquo;
dramaturgically, and in form the most distinctly
fantastic of all Maeterlinck's productions,
is still farther removed from the fatalistic atmosphere.
This play sounds, as the author himself
has stated, &ldquo;the triumph of will and love over
destiny or fatality,&rdquo; as against the converse lesson
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monna Vanna</i>. The idea is symbolically
expressed in the temptations of Lanceor and in
the liberation of Joyzelle and her lover from the
power of Merlin and his familiar, Arielle, who
impersonates the secret forces of the heart.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aglavaine et Selysette</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monna Vanna</i>, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Joyzelle</i> mark by still another sign the advent of
a new phase in Maeterlinck's evolution; namely,
by the characterization of the heroines. Previously,
the women in his plays were hardly individualized
and none of them can be said to
possess a physiognomy strictly her own. Maeterlinck
had returned with great partiality again
and again to the same type of woman: languid and
listless, without stamina and strength, yet at the
same time full of deep feeling, and capable of
unending devotion&mdash;pathetic incorporeal figures
feeling their way along without the light of self-consciousness,
like some pre-raphaelite species of
somnambulists. In the new plays, on the contrary,
women of a courageous and venturesome
spirit and with a self-possessive assurance are portrayed
by preference and with unmistakable approval.</p>

<p>As the technique in the more recent creations
of Maeterlinck, so the diction, too, accommodates
itself to altered tendencies. Whereas formerly
the colloquy was abrupt and fragmentary, it is
now couched in cadenced, flowing language, which,
nevertheless, preserves the old-time simplicity.
The poet himself has criticized his former dialogue.
He said it made those figures seem like
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>
deaf people walking in their sleep, whom somebody
is endeavoring to arouse from a heavy
dream.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>For the limited purpose of this sketch it is not
needful to enter into a detailed discussion of Maeterlinck's
latest productions, since such lines as
they add to his philosophical and artistic physiognomy
have been traced beforehand. His literary
output for the last dozen years or so is embodied
in six or seven volumes: about two years to a
book seems to be his normal ratio of achievement,
the same as was so regularly observed by
Henrik Ibsen, and one that seems rather suitable
for an author whose reserve, dictated by a profound
artistic and moral conscience, like his actual
performance, calls for admiration and gratitude.
During the war he has written, or at least
published, very little. It is fairly safe to assume
that the emotional experience of this harrowing
period will control his future philosophy as its
most potent factor; equally safe is it to predict,
on the strength of his published utterances, that
his comprehensive humanity, that has been put
to such a severe test, will pass unscathed through
the ordeal.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>Of the last group of Maeterlinck's works only
two are dramas, namely, &ldquo;The Blue Bird,&rdquo;
(1909), and &ldquo;Mary Magdalene,&rdquo; (1910). The
baffling symbolism of &ldquo;The Blue Bird&rdquo; has not
stood in the way of a tremendous international
stage success; the fact is due much less to the
simple line of thought that runs through the
puzzle than to the exuberant fancy that gave rise
to it and its splendid scenical elaboration. Probably
Mr. Henry Rose is right, in his helpful analysis
of &ldquo;The Blue Bird,&rdquo; in venturing the assertion
that &ldquo;by those who are familiar with Swedenborg's
teaching &lsquo;The Blue Bird&rsquo; must be recognized
as to a very large extent written on lines
which are in accordance with what is known as
the Science of Correspondences&mdash;a very important
part of Swedenborg's teachings.&rdquo; But the understanding
of this symbolism in its fullness offers
very great difficulties. That a definite and consistent
meaning underlies all its features will be
rather felt than comprehended by the great majority
who surely cannot be expected to go to the
trouble first of familiarizing themselves with Maeterlinck's
alleged code of symbols and then of
applying it meticulously to the interpretation of
his plays.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>&ldquo;Mary Magdalene,&rdquo; judged from the dramatic
point of view, is a quite impressive tragedy, yet
a full and sufficient treatment of the very suggestive
scriptural legend it is not. The converted
courtezan is characterized too abstractly. Instead
of presenting herself as a woman consumed with
blazing sensuality but in whom the erotic fire is
transmuted into religious passion, she affects us
like an enacted commentary upon such a most
extraordinary experience.</p>

<p>Finally, there are several volumes of essays, to
some of which reference has already been made.<a name="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">(9)</a>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Temple Enseveli</i> (&ldquo;The Buried Temple&rdquo;),
(1902), consists of six disquisitions, all dealing
with metaphysical subjects: Justice, The Evolution
of Mystery, The Reign of Matter, The Past,
Chance, The Future. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Double Jardin</i> (&ldquo;The
Double Garden&rdquo;), (1904), is much more miscellaneous
in its makeup. These are its heterogeneous
subjects: The Death of a Little Dog, Monte
Carlo, A Ride in a Motor Car, Dueling, The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>
Angry Temper of the Bees, Universal Suffrage,
The Modern Drama, The Sources of Spring,
Death and the Crown (a discussion upon the fatal
illness of Edward&nbsp;VII), a View of Rome, Field
Flowers, Chrysanthemums, Old-fashioned Flowers,
Sincerity, The Portrait of Woman, and Olive
Branches (a survey of certain now, alas, obsolete
ethical movements of that day). <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Intelligence
des Fleurs</i> (in the translation it is named &ldquo;Life
and Flowers,&rdquo; in an enlarged issue &ldquo;The Measure
of the Hours,&rdquo; both 1907), takes up, besides the
theme of the general caption, the manufacture of
perfumes, the various instruments for measuring
time, the psychology of accident, social duty, war,
prize-fighting, and &ldquo;King Lear.&rdquo; In 1912, three
essays on Emerson, Novalis, and Ruysbroeck appeared
collectively, in English, under the title &ldquo;On
Emerson and Other Essays.&rdquo; These originally
prefaced certain works of those writers translated
by Maeterlinck in his earlier years.</p>

<p>Maeterlinck's most recent publications are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Mort</i> (published in English in a considerably extended
collection under the title &ldquo;Our Eternity&rdquo;),
(1913), &ldquo;The Unknown Guest,&rdquo; (1914), and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Débris de la Guerre</i> (&ldquo;The Wrack of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>
Storm&rdquo;), (1916).<a name="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">(10)</a> The two first named, having
for their central subject Death and the great concomitant
problem of the life beyond, show that the
author has become greatly interested in psychical
research; he even goes so far as to affirm his belief
in precognition. In these essays, Theosophy and
Spiritism and kindred occult theories are carefully
analyzed, yet ingenious as are the author's
speculations, they leave anything like a solution
of the perplexing riddles far afield. On the whole
he inclines to a telepathic explanation of the psychical
phenomena, yet thinks they may be due to the
strivings of the cosmic intelligence after fresh
outlets, and believes that a careful and persistent
investigation of these phenomena may open up
hitherto undreamt of realms of reality. In general,
we find him on many points less assertive
than he was in the beginning and inclined to a
general retrenchment of the dogmatic element in
his philosophic attitude. A significant passage in
&ldquo;The Buried Treasure&rdquo; teaches us not to deplore
the loss of fixed beliefs. &ldquo;One should never look
back with regret to those hours when a great belief
abandons us. A faith that becomes extinct,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>
a means that fails, a dominant idea that no longer
dominates us because we think it is our turn to
dominate it&mdash;these things prove that we are living,
that we are progressing, that we are using up a
great many things because we are not standing
still.&rdquo; Of the gloomy fatalism of his literary beginnings
hardly a trace is to be found in the Maeterlinck
of to-day. His war-book, &ldquo;The Wrack
of the Storm,&rdquo; breathes a calm optimism in the
face of untold disaster. The will of man is put
above the power of fate. &ldquo;Is it possible that fatality&mdash;by
which I mean what perhaps for a moment
was the unacknowledged desire of the planet&mdash;shall
not regain the upper hand? At the stage
which man has reached, I hope and believe so&hellip;.
Everything seems to tell us that man is approaching
the day whereon, seizing the most glorious
opportunity that has ever presented itself
since he acquired a consciousness, he will at last
learn that he is able, when he pleases, to control
his whole fate in this world.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">(11)</a> His faith in humanity
is built on the heroic virtues displayed in
this war. &ldquo;To-day, not only do we know that
these virtues exist: we have taught the world that
they are always triumphant, that nothing is lost
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
while faith is left, while honor is intact, while love
continues, while the soul does not surrender.&rdquo; &hellip;
Death itself is now threatened with extinction by
our heroic race: &ldquo;The more it exercises its ravages,
the more it increases the intensity of that
which it cannot touch; the more it pursues its
phantom victories, the better does it prove to us
that man will end by conquering death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the concluding chapter of &ldquo;Our Eternity,&rdquo;
the romantic modification of Maeterlinck's mysticism
is made patent in his confession regarding the
problem of Knowledge: &ldquo;I have added nothing
to what was already known. I have simply tried
to separate what may be true from that which is
assuredly not true&hellip;. Perhaps through our
quest for that undiscoverable Truth we shall have
accustomed our eyes to pierce the terror of the
last hour by looking it full in the face&hellip;. We
need have no hope that any one will utter on this
earth the word that shall put an end to our uncertainties.
It is very probable, on the contrary,
that no one in this world, nor perhaps in the next,
will discover the great secret of the universe.
And &hellip; it is most fortunate that it should be so.
We have not only to resign ourselves to living in
the incomprehensible, but to rejoice that we cannot
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
get out of it. If there were no more insoluble
questions &hellip; infinity would not be infinite; and
then we should have forever to curse the fate
that placed us in a universe proportionate to our
intelligence. The unknown and the unknowable
are necessary and will perhaps always be necessary
to our happiness. In any case, I would not
wish my worst enemy, were his understanding a
thousandfold loftier and a thousandfold mightier
than mine, to be condemned eternally to inhabit
a world of which he had surprised an essential
secret&hellip;.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">(12)</a></p>

<p>So the final word of Maeterlinck's philosophy,
after a lifetime of ardent search, clears up none
of the tantalizing secrets of our existence. And
yet somehow it bears a message that is full of consolation.
The value of human life lies in the perpetual
movement towards a receding goal. Whoever
can identify himself with such a philosophy
and accept its great practical lesson, that we shall
never reach Knowledge but acquire wisdom in the
pursuit, should be able to envisage the veiled countenance
of Truth without despair, and even to face
with some courage the eternal problem of our
being, its reason and its destination.

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>II<br/>
<small>THE ECCENTRICITY OF AUGUST STRINDBERG</small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> cannot speak of August Strindberg
with much <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gusto</i>. The most broadminded
critic will find himself under necessity
to disapprove of him as a man and to condemn
so many features of his production that almost
one might question his fitness as a subject of literary
discussion. Nevertheless, his importance is
beyond dispute and quite above the consideration
of personal like or dislike, whether we view him
in his creative capacity,&mdash;as an intellectual and
ethical spokesman of his time,&mdash;or in his human
character,&mdash;as a typical case of certain mental
and moral maladies which somehow during his
time were more or less epidemic throughout the
lettered world. We have it on excellent authority
that at his début in the literary theatre he made
the stage quake with the elemental power of his
personality. Gigantic rebels like Ibsen, Bjoernson,
Nietzsche, and Tolstoy, we are told, dwindled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>
to normal proportions beside his titanic stature.
He aimed to conquer and convert the whole world
by his fanatical protest against the rotten civilization
of his time. The attempt proved an utter
failure. He never could grow into a world-figure,
because he lacked the courage as well as the cosmopolitan
adaptability needed for intellectual expatriation.
Hence, in great contrast to Ibsen, he
remained to Europe at large the uncouth Scandinavian,
while in the eyes of Scandinavia he was
specifically the Swede; and his country-men, even
though they acknowledged him their premier poet,
treated him, because of his eccentricity, as a national
gazing-stock rather than as a genuine national
asset. Yet for all that, he ranks as the
foremost writer of his country and one of the
representative men of the age. His poetic genius
is admitted by practically all the critics, while the
greatest among them, George Brandes, pronounces
him in addition an unsurpassed master in the
command of his mother tongue. But his position
as a writer is by no means limited to his own little
country. For his works have been translated
into all civilized languages, and if the circulation
of literary products is a safe indication of their
influence, then several of Strindberg's books at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>
least must be credited with having done something
toward shaping the thought of our time upon some
of its leading issues. In any case, the large and
durable interest shown his productions marks
Strindberg as a literary phenomenon of sufficient
consequence to deserve some study.</p>

<p>Readers of Strindberg who seek to discover the
reason why criticism should have devoted so much
attention to an author regarded almost universally
with strong disapproval and aversion, will find
that reason most probably in the extreme subjectiveness
that dominates everything he has written;
personal confession, novels, stories, and plays
alike share this equality, and even in his historical
dramas the figures, despite the minute accuracy of
their delineation, are moved by the author's passion,
not their own. Rarely, if ever, has a writer
of eminence demonstrated a similar incapacity to
reproduce the thoughts and feelings of other people.
It has been rightly declared that all his leading
characters are merely the outward projections
of his own sentiments and ideas,&mdash;that at bottom
he, August Strindberg, is the sole protagonist in
all his dramaturgy and fiction.</p>

<p>Strindberg was a man with an omnivorous intellectual
curiosity, and he commanded a vast store
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>
of knowledge in the fields of history, science, and
languages. His &ldquo;History of the Swedish People&rdquo;
is recognized by competent judges as a very brilliant
and scholarly performance. Before he was
launched in his literary career, and while still obscurely
employed as minor assistant at a library,
he earned distinction as a student of the Chinese
language, and one product of his research work in
that field was even deemed worthy of being read
before the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Académie des Inscriptions et Belles
Lettres</i>. In Geology, Chemistry, Botany, he was
equally productive. But the taint of eccentricity
in his mental fibre prevented his imposing scientific
accomplishments from maintaining him in a state
of intellectual equilibrium. He laid as much store
by things of which he had a mere smattering as
by those on which he was an authority, and his
resultant unsteadiness caused him to oscillate between
opposite scientific enthusiasms even as his
self-contradictory personal character involved him
in abrupt changes of position, and made him jump
from one extreme of behavior to the other.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Strindberg first attracted public notice by the
appearance in 1879 of a novel named &ldquo;The Red
Room.&rdquo; Its effect upon a country characterized
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>
by so keen an observer as George Brandes as perhaps
the most conservative in Europe resembled
the excitement caused by Schiller's &ldquo;The Robbers&rdquo;
almost precisely one hundred years before. It
stirred up enough dust to change, though not to
cleanse, the musty atmosphere of Philistia. For
here was instantly recognized the challenge of a
radical spirit uprisen in full and ruthless rebellion
against each and every time-hallowed usage and
tradition. The recollection of that hot-spur agitator
bent with every particle of his strength to
rouse the world up from its lethargy by his stentorian
&ldquo;J'accuse&rdquo; and to pass sentence upon it by
sheer tremendous vociferation, is almost entirely
obliterated to-day by the remembrance of quite
another Strindberg:&mdash;the erstwhile stormy idealist
changed into a leering cynic; a repulsive embodiment
of negation, a grimacing Mephistopheles
who denies life and light or anything that he cannot
comprehend, and to whom the face of the
earth appears forever covered with darkness and
filth and death and corruption. Indeed this final
depictment of August Strindberg, whether or no
it be accurately true to life, is a terrible example
of what life can make of a man, or a man of his
life, if he is neither light enough to be borne by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>
the current of his time, nor strong enough to set
his face against the tide and breast it.</p>

<p>The question is, naturally, was Strindberg sincere
in the fanatical insurgency of his earlier
period, or was his attitude merely a theatrical pose
and his social enthusiasm a ranting declamation?
In either case, there opens up this other question:
Have we reason to doubt the sincerity of the mental
changes that were yet to follow,&mdash;the genuineness
of his pessimism, occultism, and, in the final
stage, of his religious conversion? His unexampled
hardihood in reversing his opinions and
going dead against his convictions could be illustrated
in nearly every sphere of thought. At one
time a glowing admirer of Rousseau and loudly
professing his gospel of nature, he forsook this
allegiance, and chose as his new idol Rousseau's
very antipode, Voltaire. For many years he was
a democrat of the purest water, identified himself
with the proletarian cause, and acted as the fiery
champion of the poor labor-driven masses against
their oppressors; but one fine day, no matter
whether it came about directly through his contact
with Nietzsche or otherwise, he repudiated socialism,
scornfully denouncing it as a tattered remnant
of his cast-off Christianity, and arrayed himself
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>
on the side of the elect, or self-elect, against the
&ldquo;common herd,&rdquo; the &ldquo;much-too-many.&rdquo; License
for the best to govern the rest, became temporarily
his battle-cry; and his political ideal suggested
nothing less completely absurd than a republic presided
over by an oligarchy of autocrats. His unsurpassed
reputation as an anti-feminist would
hardly prepare us to find his earlier works fairly
aglow with sympathy for the woman cause. He
held at one time, as did Tolstoy, that art and
poetry have a detrimental effect upon the natural
character; for which reason the peasant is a more
normal being than the lettered man. Especially
was he set against the drama, on the ground that
it throws the public mind into confusion by its
failure to differentiate sharply between the author's
own opinions and those of the characters.
Literature, he held, should pattern itself after a
serious newspaper: it should seek to influence,
not entertain. Not only did he drop this pedantic
restriction of literature in the end, but in his own
practice he had always defied it, because, despite
his fierce campaign against art, he could not overcome
the force of his artistic impulses. And so in
other provinces of thought, too, he reversed his
judgment with a temerity and swiftness that greatly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
offended the feelings and perplexed the intelligence
of his followers for the time being and justified
the question whether Strindberg had any principles
at all. In politics he was by quick turns
Anarchist and Socialist, Radical and Conservative,
Republican and Aristocrat, Communist and Egoist;
in religion, Pietist, Protestant, Deist, Atheist,
Occultist, and Roman Catholic. And yet unquestionably
he was honest. To blame him merely
because he changed his views, and be it never so
radically, would be blaming a man for exercising
his right to develop. In any man of influence, an
unalterable permanency of opinion would be even
more objectionable than a frequent shift of his
point of view. In recent times the presumable
length of a person's intellectual usefulness has
been a live subject of discussion which has resulted
in some legislation of very questionable
wisdom, for instance the setting of an arbitrary
age limit for the active service of high-grade teachers.
In actual experience men are too old to teach,
or through any other function to move the minds
of younger people in a forward direction, whenever
they have lost the ability to change their own
mind. Yet at all events, an eminent author's right
of self-reversal must not be exercised at random;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>
he should refrain from the propagation of new
opinions that have not ripened within himself.
Which is the same as saying that he should stick
to his old opinions until he finds himself inwardly
compelled to abandon them. But as a matter of
fact, a man like Strindberg, propelled by an unbridled
imagination, alert with romantic tendencies,
nervously overstrung, kept constantly under a
strain by his morbidly sensitive temperament,&mdash;and
whose brain is consequently a seething chaos
of conflicting ideas, is never put to the necessity
of changing his mind; his mind keeps changing itself.</p>

<p>It must be as difficult for the literary historian
to do Strindberg full justice as it was for the great
eccentric himself; when in taking stock, as it were,
of his mental equipment, during one of his protracted
periods of despondency, he summed himself
up in the following picturesque simile: &ldquo;A
monstrous conglomeration, changing its forms according
to the observer's point of view and possessing
no more reality than the rainbow that is
visible to the eyes and yet does not exist.&rdquo; His
evolution may be tracked, however, in the detailed
autobiography in which he undertook, by a rigorous
application of Hippolyte Taine's well-known
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>
theory and method, to account for his temperamental
peculiarities on the basis of heredity and
the milieu and to describe the gradual transformation
of his character through education and the
external pressure of contemporary intellectual
movements. This remarkable work is like a picture
book of ideals undermined, hollowed, and
shattered; a perverse compound of cynicism and
passion, it is unspeakably loathsome to the sense
of beauty and yet, in the last artistic reckoning,
not without great beauty of its own. It divides
the story of Strindberg's life into these consecutive
parts: The Son of the Servant; The Author;
The Evolution of a Soul; The Confession of a
Fool; Inferno; Legends; The Rupture; Alone.
The very titles signalize the brutal frankness, or,
shall we say, terrible sincerity of a tale that rummages
without piety among the most sacred privacies,
and drags forth from intimate nooks and corners
sorrow and squalor and shame enough to
have wrecked a dozen average existences. There
is no mistaking or evading the challenge hurled
by this story: See me as I am, stripped of conventional
lies and pretensions! Look upon my
naked soul, covered with scars and open sores.
Behold me in my spasms of love and hate, now in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
demoniacal transports, now prostrate with anguish!
And if you want to know how I came to
be what I am, consider my ancestry, my bringing
up, my social environment, and be sure also to
pocket your own due share of the blame for my destruction!&mdash;Certainly
Strindberg's autobiography
is not to be recommended as a graduation gift for
convent-bred young ladies, or as a soothing diversion
for convalescents, but if accepted in a proper
sense, it will be found absorbing, informative, and
even helpful.</p>

<p>Strindberg never forgave his father for having
married below his station. He felt that the good
blood of the Strindbergs,&mdash;respectable merchants
and ministers and country gentlemen,&mdash;was
worsened by the proletarian strain imported into
it through a working girl named Eleonore Ulrike
Norling, the mother of August Strindberg and his
eleven brothers and sisters. During August's
childhood the family lived in extremely straitened
circumstances. When a dozen people live cooped
up in three rooms, some of them are more than
likely to have the joy of youth crushed out of
them and crowded from the premises. Here was
the first evil that darkened Strindberg's life: he
simply was cheated out of his childhood.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>School was no happier place for him than home.
His inordinate pride, only sharpened by the consciousness
of his parents' poverty which bordered
on pauperism, threw him into a state of perpetual
rebellion against comrades and teachers. And all
this time his inner life was tossed hither and
thither by a general intellectual and emotional
restlessness due to an insatiable craving for knowledge.
At fifteen years of age he had reached a full
conviction on the irredeemable evilness of life;
and concluded, in a moment of religious exaltation,
to dedicate his own earthly existence to the
vicarious expiation of universal sin through the
mortification of the flesh. Then, of a sudden, he
became a voracious reader of rationalistic literature,
and turned atheist with almost inconceivable
dispatch, but soon was forced back by remorse
into the pietistic frame of mind,&mdash;only to pass
through another reaction immediately after. At
this time he claims that earthly life is a punishment
or a probation; but that it lies in man's power
to make it endurable by freeing himself from the
social restraints. He has become a convert to
the fantastic doctrine of Jean Jacques Rousseau,
that man is good by nature but has been depraved
by civilization. Now in his earliest twenties, he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>
embraces communism with all its implications,&mdash;free
love, state parenthood, public ownership of
utilities, equal division of the fruits of labor, and
so forth,&mdash;as the sole and sure means of salvation
for humanity.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Swiss Stories,&rdquo; subtitled &ldquo;Utopias in
Reality,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">(13)</a> Strindberg demonstrated to his own
satisfaction the smooth and practical workings
of that doctrine. It was difficult for him to understand
why the major part of the world seemed so
hesitant about adopting so tempting and equitable
a scheme of living. Yet, for his own person, too,
he soon disavowed socialism, because under a
socialistic régime the individual would be liable to
have his ideas put into uniform, and the remotest
threat of interference with his freedom of thought
was something this fanatical apostle of liberty
could not brook.</p>

<p>In the preface to the &ldquo;Utopias,&rdquo; he had referred
to himself as &ldquo;a convinced socialist, like all
sensible people&rdquo;; whereas now he writes: &ldquo;Idealism
and Socialism are two maladies born of laziness.&rdquo;
Having thus scientifically diagnosed the
disease and prescribed the one true specific for it,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>
namely&mdash;how simple!&mdash;the total abolition of the
industries, he resumes the preaching of Rousseauism
in its simon-pure form, orders every man to
be his maid-of-all-work and jack-of-all-trades,
puts the world on a vegetarian diet, and then wonders
why the socialists denounce and revile him as
a turncoat and an apostate.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The biography throws an especially vivid light
on Strindberg's relation to one of the most important
factors of socialism, to wit, the question
of woman's rights. His position on this issue is
merely a phase of that extreme and practically
isolated position in regard to woman in general
that has more than any other single element determined
the feeling of the public towards him
and by consequence fixed his place in contemporary
literature. That this should be so is hardly
unfair, because no other element has entered so
deeply into the structure and fibre of his thought
and feeling.</p>

<p>Strindberg, as has been stated, was not from
the outset, or perchance constitutionally, an anti-feminist.
In &ldquo;The Red Room&rdquo; he preaches equality
of the sexes even in marriage. The thesis of
the book is that man and woman are not antagonistic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>
phenomena of life, rather they are modifications
of the same phenomenon, made for mutual
completion; hence, they can only fulfill their natural
destiny through close coöperative comradeship.
But there were two facts that prevented
Strindberg from proceeding farther along this
line of thought. One was his incorrigible propensity
to contradiction, the other his excessive
subjectiveness which kept him busy building up
theories on the basis of personal experience. The
prodigious feminist movement launched in Scandinavia
by Ibsen and Bjoernson was very repugnant
to him, because he felt, not without some just reason,
that the movement was for a great many
people little more than a fad. So long as art and
literature are influenced by fashion, so long there
will be and should be revolts against the vogue.
Moreover, Strindberg felt that the movement was
being carried too far. He was prepared to accompany
Ibsen some distance on the way of reform,
but refused to subscribe to his verdict that
the whole blame for our crying social maladjustments
rests with the unwillingness of men to allot
any rights whatsoever to women.</p>

<p>Strindberg's play, &ldquo;Sir Bengt's Wife,&rdquo; printed
in 1882, but of much earlier origin, is interpreted
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>
by Brandes as a symbolical portrayal of feminine
life in Scandinavia during the author's early manhood.
The leading feminine figure, a creature
wholly incapable of understanding or appreciating
the nobler traits in man, is nevertheless treated
with sympathy, on the whole. She is represented,&mdash;like
Selma Bratsberg in Ibsen's &ldquo;The League
of Youth,&rdquo; and Nora Helmer, in &ldquo;A Doll's
House,&rdquo;&mdash;as the typical and normal victim of a
partial and unfair training. Her faults of judgment
and errors of temper are due to the fact so
forcefully descanted upon by Selma, that women
are not permitted to share the interests and anxieties
of their husbands. We are expressly informed
by Strindberg that this drama was intended,
in the first place, as an attack upon the romantic
proclivities of feminine education; in the
second, as an illustration of the power of love to
subdue the will; in the third, as a defense of the
thesis that woman's love is of a higher quality than
man's; and lastly, as a vindication of the right of
woman to be her own master. Again, in &ldquo;Married&rdquo;
he answers the query, Shall women vote?
distinctly in the affirmative, although here the
fixed idea about the congenital discordance between
the sexes, and the identification of love with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
a struggle for supremacy, has already seized hold
of him.</p>

<p>To repeat, there was at first nothing absolutely
preposterous about Strindberg's position in regard
to the woman movement. On the contrary, his
view might have been endorsed as a not altogether
unwholesome corrective for the ruling fashion of
dealing with the issue by the advocacy of extremes.
But by force of his supervening personal grievance
against the sex, Strindberg's anti-feminism became
in the long run the fixed pole about which gravitated
his entire system of social and ethical
thought. His campaign against feminism, which
otherwise could have served a good purpose by
curbing wild militancy, was defeated by its own
exaggerations. Granting that feminists had gone
too far in the denunciation of male brutality and
despotism, Strindberg went still farther in the opposite
direction, when he deliberately set out to
lay bare the character of woman by dissecting
some of her most diabolical incarnations. As has
already been said, he was utterly incapable of
objective thinking, and under the sting of his
miseries in love and marriage, dislike of woman
turned into hatred and hatred into frenzy. Henceforth,
the entire spectacle of life presented itself
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
to his distorted vision as a perpetual state of war
between the sexes: on the one side he saw the
male, strong of mind and heart, but in the generosity
of strength guileless and over-trustful; on the
other side, the female, weak of body and intellect,
but shrewd enough to exploit her frailness by linking
iniquity to impotence and contriving by her
treacherous cunning to enslave her natural superior:&mdash;it
is the story of Samson and Delilah
made universal in its application. Love is shown
up as the trap in which man is caught to be shorn
of his power. The case against woman is classically
drawn up in &ldquo;The Father,&rdquo; one of the
strangest and at the same time most powerful
tragedies of Strindberg. The principals of the
plot stand for the typical character difference between
the sexes as Strindberg sees it; the man being
kind-hearted, good-natured, and aspiring, whereas
the woman, setting an example for all his succeeding
portraits of women, is cunning, though unintelligent
and coarse-grained, soulless, yet insanely
ambitious and covetous of power. In glaring contrast
to the situation made so familiar by Ibsen,
we here see the man struggling away from the
clutches of a woman who declares frankly that
she has never looked at a man without feeling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
conscious of her superiority over him. In this
play the man, a person of ideals and real ability,
who is none other than Strindberg himself in one
of his matrimonial predicaments, fails to extricate
himself from the snare, and ends&mdash;both literally
and figuratively&mdash;by being put into the straitjacket.</p>

<p>Without classing Strindberg as one of the great
world dramatists, it would be narrow-minded,
after experiencing the gripping effect of some of
his plays, to deny them due recognition, for indeed
they would be remarkable for their perspicacity
and penetration, even if they were devoid
of any value besides. They contain the keenest
analyses ever made of the vicious side of feminine
character, obtained by specializing, as it were,
on the more particularly feminine traits of human
depravity. Assuredly the procedure is onesided,
but the delineation of a single side of life is beyond
peradventure a legitimate artistic enterprise
as long as it is not palmed upon us as an accurate
and complete picture. Unfortunately, Strindberg's
abnormal vision falsifies the things he looks at,
and, being steeped in his insuperable prejudice, his
pictures of life, in spite of the partial veracity they
possess, never rise above the level of caricatures.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>He was incompetent to pass judgment upon an
individual woman separately; to him all women
were alike, and that means, all unmitigatedly bad!
To the objection raised by one of the characters
in &ldquo;The Father&rdquo;: &ldquo;Oh, there are so many kinds
of women,&rdquo; the author's mouthpiece makes this
clinching answer: &ldquo;Modern investigation has pronounced
that there is only one kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The autobiography of Strindberg is largely inspired
by his unreasoning hatred of women; the
result, in the main, of his three unfortunate ventures
into the uncongenial field of matrimony. In
its first part, the account of his life is not without
some traces of healthy humor, but as the story
progresses, his entire philosophy of life becomes
more and more aberrant under the increasing pressure
of that obsession. He gets beside himself
at the mere mention of anything feminine, and
blindly hits away, let his bludgeon land where it
will; logic, common sense, and common decency
go to the floor before his vehement and brutal
assault. Every woman is a born liar and traitor.
Her sole aim in life is to thrive parasitically upon
the revenue of her favors. Since marriage and
prostitution cannot provide a living for all, the
oversupply now clamor for admission to the work-mart;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
but they are incompetent and lazy, and inveterate
shirkers of responsibility. With triumphant
malice he points to the perfidious readiness of
woman to perform her tasks by proxy, that is, to
delegate them to hired substitutes: her children are
tended and taught by governesses and teachers;
her garments are made by dressmakers and seamstresses;
the duties of her household she unloads
on servants,&mdash;and from selfish considerations of
vanity, comfort, and love of pleasure, she withdraws
even from the primary maternal obligation
and lets her young be nourished at the breast of a
stranger. Strindberg in his rage never stops to
think that the deputies in these cases,&mdash;cooks and
housemaids and nurses and so forth,&mdash;themselves
belong to the female sex, by which fact the impeachment
is in large part invalidated.</p>

<p>The play bearing the satirical title &ldquo;Comrades&rdquo;
makes a special application of the theory about
the pre-established antagonism of the sexes. In
a situation similar to that in &ldquo;The Father,&rdquo; husband
and wife are shown in a yet sharper antithesis
of character: a man of sterling character
and ability foiled by a woman in all respects his
inferior, yet imperiously determined to dominate
him. At first she seems to succeed in her ambition,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>
and in the same measure as she assumes a
more and more mannish demeanor, the husband's
behavior grows more and more effeminate. But
the contest leads to results opposite to those in
&ldquo;The Father.&rdquo; Here, the man, once he is brought
to a full realization of his plight, arouses himself
from his apathy, reasserts his manhood, and, in
the ensuing fight for supremacy, routs the usurper
and comes into his own. The steps by which he
passes through revolt from subjection to self-liberation,
are cleverly signaled by his outward
transformation, as he abandons the womanish
style of dressing imposed on him by his wife's
whim and indignantly flings into a corner the feminine
costume which she would make him wear at
the ball.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Leaving aside, then, all question as to their artistic
value, Strindberg's dramas are deserving of
attention as experiments in a fairly unexplored
field of analytic psychology. They are the first
literary creations of any great importance begotten
by such bitter hatred of woman. The anti-feminism
of Strindberg's predecessors, not excepting
that arch-misogynist, Arthur Schopenhauer
himself, sprang from contempt, not from abhorrence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>
and abject fear. In Strindberg, misogyny
turns into downright gynophobia. To him, woman
is not an object of disdain, but the cruel and merciless
persecutor of man. In order to disclose the
most dangerous traits of the feminine soul, Strindberg
dissects it by a method that corresponds
closely to Ibsen's astonishing demonstration of
masculine viciousness. The wide-spread dislike
for Strindberg's dramas is due, in equal parts, to
the detestableness of his male characters, and to
the optimistic disbelief of the general public in the
reality of womanhood as he represents it. Strindberg's
portraiture of the sex appears as a monstrous
slander, principally because no other painter
has ever placed the model into the same disadvantageous
light, and the authenticity of his pictures
is rendered suspicious by their abnormal family
resemblance. He was obsessed with the petrifying
vision of a uniform cruel selfishness staring
out of every woman's face: countess, courtezan,
or kitchen maid, all are cast in the same gorgon
mold.</p>

<p>Strindberg's aversion towards women was probably
kindled into action, as has already been intimated,
by his disgust at the sudden irruption of
woman worship into literature; but, as has also
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
been made clear, only the disillusionments and
grievances of his private experience hardened that
aversion into implacable hatred. At first he simply
declined to ally himself with the feminist cult, because
the women he knew seemed unworthy of
being worshipped,&mdash;little vain dolls, frivolous coquettes,
and pedants given to domestic tyranny,
of such the bulk was made up. Under the maddening
spur of his personal misfortunes, his feeling
passed from weariness to detestation, from
detestation to a bitter mixture of fear and furious
hate. He conceived it as his supreme mission
and central purpose in life to unmask the demon
with the angel's face, to tear the drapings from
the idol and expose to view the hideous ogress that
feeds on the souls of men. Woman, in Strindberg's
works, is a bogy, constructed out of the
vilest ingredients that enter into the composition
of human nature, with a kind of convulsive life
infused by a remnant of great artistic power. And
this grewsome fabric of a diseased imagination,
like Frankenstein's monster, wreaks vengeance on
its maker. His own mordant desire for her is the
lash that drives him irresistibly to his destruction.</p>

<p>It requires no profound psychologic insight to
divine in this odious chimera the deplorable abortion
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
of a fine ideal. The distortion of truth emanates
in Strindberg's work, as it does in any significant
satire or caricature, from indignation over
the contrast between a lofty conception and a
disappointing reality. What, after all, can be the
mission of this hard-featured gallery of females,&mdash;peevish,
sullen, impudent, grasping, violent, lecherous,
malignant, and vindictive,&mdash;if it is not to mark
pravity and debasement with a stigma in the name
of a pure and noble womanhood?</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It should not be left unmentioned that we owe
to August Strindberg some works of great perfection
fairly free from the black obsession and with
a constructive and consistently idealistic tendency:
splendid descriptions of a quaint people and their
habitat, tinged with a fine sense of humor, as in
&ldquo;The Hemsoe-Dwellers&rdquo;; charming studies of
landscape and of floral and animal life, in the
&ldquo;Portraits of Flowers and Animals&rdquo;; the colossal
work on the Swedish People, once before referred
to, a history conceived and executed in a thoroughly
modern scientific spirit; two volumes of &ldquo;Swedish
Fortunes and Adventures&rdquo;; most of his historic
dramas also are of superior order. But
these works lie outside the scope of the more specific
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>
discussion of Strindberg as a mystic and an
eccentric to which this sketch is devoted. We may
conclude by briefly considering the final phases of
Strindberg's checkered intellectual career, and by
summing up his general significance for the age.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that during the middle period
of his life, (in 1888), Strindberg came into personal
touch with Nietzsche. The effect of the latter's
sensational philosophy is clearly perceptible
in the works of that period, notably in &ldquo;Tschandala&rdquo;
and &ldquo;By the Open Sea.&rdquo; Evidently, Nietzsche,
at first, was very congenial to him. For
both men were extremely aristocratic in their instincts.
For a while, Strindberg endorsed unqualifiedly
the heterodox ethics of the towering
paranoiac. For one thing, that philosophy supplied
fresh food and fuel to his burning rage against
womankind, and that was enough to bribe him into
swallowing, for the time being, the entire substance
of Nietzsche's fantastic doctrine. He took
the same ground as Nietzsche, that the race had
deteriorated in consequence of its sentimentality,
namely through the systematic protection of physical
and mental inferiority and unchecked procreation
of weaklings. He seconded Nietzsche's motion
that society should exterminate its parasites,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>
instead of pampering them. Mankind can only
be reinvigorated if the strong and healthy are
helped to come into their own. The dreams of the
pacifists are fatal to the pragmatic virtues and to
the virility of the race. The greatest need is an
aggressive campaign for the moral and intellectual
sanitation of the world. So let the brain rule over
the heart,&mdash;and so forth in the same strain.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, Strindberg passed out of
the sphere of Nietzsche's influence. The alienation
was due as much to his general instability as
to the disparity between his pessimistic temper and
the joyous exaltation of Zarathustra-ism. His
striking reversion to orthodoxy was by no means
illogical. Between pessimism and faith there exists
a relation that is not very far to seek. When
a person has forfeited his peace of soul and cannot
find grace before his own conscience, he might
clutch as a last hope the promise of vicarious redemption.
Extending the significance of his own
personal experience to everything within his horizon,
and erecting a dogmatic system upon this
tenuous generalisation, Strindberg reached the
conviction that the purpose of living is to suffer,
a conviction that threw his philosophy well into
line with the religious and ethical ideas of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
middle age. Yet even at this juncture his cynicism
did not desert him, as witness this comment of his:
&ldquo;Religion must be a punishment, because nobody
gets religion who does not have a bad conscience.&rdquo;
This avowal preceded his saltatory approach to
Roman Catholicism.</p>

<p>In the later volumes of his autobiography he
minutely describes the successive crises through
which he passed in his agonizing search for certitude
and salvation before his spirit found rest in
the idea of Destiny which formerly to him was
synonymous with Fate and now became synonymous
with Providence. &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; pictures his existence
as a protracted and unbroken nightmare.
He turned determinist, then fatalist, then mystic.
The most trifling incidents of his daily life were
spelt out according to Swedenborg's &ldquo;Science of
Correspondences&rdquo; and thereby assumed a deep
and terrifying significance. In the most trivial
events, such as the opening or shutting of a door,
or the curve etched by a raindrop on a dusty pane
of glass, he perceived intimations from the occult
power that directed his life. Into the most ordinary
occurrence of the day he read a divine order,
or threat, or chastisement. He was tormented
by terrible dreams and visions; in the guise of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>
ferocious beasts, his own sins agonized his flesh.
And in the midst of all these tortures he studied
and practised the occult arts: magic, astrology,
necromancy, alchemy; he concocted gold by hermetical
science! To all appearances utterly deranged,
he was still lucid enough at intervals to
carry on chemical, botanical, and physiological experiments
of legitimate worth. Then his reason
cleared up once again and put a sudden end to an
episode which he has described in these words:
&ldquo;To go in quest of God and to find the devil,&mdash;that
is what happened to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took leave of Swedenborg as he had taken
leave of Nietzsche, yet retained much gratitude
for him; the great Scandinavian seer had brought
him back to God, so he averred, even though the
conversion was effected by picturings of horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Legends,&rdquo; the further continuation of his self-history,
shows him vividly at his closest contact
with the Catholic Church. But the most satisfactory
portion of the autobiography from a human
point of view, and from a literary point perhaps
altogether the best thing Strindberg has done, is
the closing book of the series, entitled &ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;
He wrote it at the age of fifty, during a period of
comparative tranquillity of mind, and that fact is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>
manifested by the composure and moderation of
its style. Now at last his storm-tossed soul seems
to have found a haven. He accepts his destiny,
and resigns himself to believing, since knowledge
is barred.</p>

<p>But even this state of serenity harbored no permanent
peace; it signified merely a temporary suspension
of those terrific internal combats.</p>

<p>In Strindberg's case, religious conversion is not
an edifying, but on the contrary a morbid and saddening
spectacle; it is equal to a declaration of
complete spiritual bankruptcy. He turns to the
church after finding all other pathways to God
blocked. His type of Christianity does not hang
together with the labors and struggles of his
secular life. A break with his past can be denied
to no man; least of all to a leader of men. Only,
if he has deserted the old road, he should be able
to lead in the new; he must have a new message
if he sees fit to cancel the old. Strindberg, however,
has nothing to offer at the end. He stands
before us timorous and shrinking, the accuser of
his fellows turned self-accuser, a beggar stretching
forth empty, trembling hands imploring forgiveness
of his sins and the salvation of his soul
through gracious mediation. His moral asseverations
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>
are either blank truisms, or intellectual aberrations.
Strindberg has added nothing to the stock
of human understanding. A preacher, of course,
is not in duty bound to generate original thought.
Indeed if such were to be exacted, our pulpits
would soon be as sparsely peopled as already are
the pews. Ministers who are wondering hard
why so many people stay away from church might
well stop to consider whether the reason is not
that a large portion of mankind has already secured,
theoretically, a religious or ethical basis of
life more or less identical with the one which
churches content themselves with offering. The
greatest religious teacher of modern times, Leo
Tolstoy, was not by any means a bringer of new
truths. The true secret of the tremendous power
which nevertheless he wielded over the souls of
men was that he extended the practical application
of what he believed. If, therefore, we look
for a lesson in Strindberg's life as recited by himself,
we shall not find it in his religious conversion.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Taken in its entirety, his voluminous yet fragmentary
life history is one of the most painful
human documents on record. One can hardly
peruse it without asking: Was Strindberg insane?
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
It is a question which he often put to himself
when remorse and self-reproach gnawed at his
conscience and when he fancied himself scorned
and persecuted by all his former friends. &ldquo;Why
are you so hated?&rdquo; he asks himself in one of his
dialogues, and this is his answer: &ldquo;I could not
endure to see mankind suffer, and so I said and
wrote: &lsquo;Free yourselves, I shall help.&rsquo; And so I
said to the poor: &lsquo;Do not let the rich suck your
blood.&rsquo; And to woman: &lsquo;Do not let man oppress
you.&rsquo; And to the children: &lsquo;Do not obey your
parents if they are unjust.&rsquo; The consequences,&mdash;well,
they are quite incomprehensible; for of a
sudden I had both sides against me, rich and poor,
men and women, parents and children; add to
that sickness and poverty, disgraceful pauperism,
my divorce, lawsuits, exile, loneliness, and now, to
top the climax,&mdash;do you believe that I am insane?&rdquo;
From his ultra-subjective point of view, the explanation
here given of the total collapse of his
fortunes is fairly accurate, at least in the essential
aspects. Still, many great men have been pursued
by a similar conflux of calamities. Overwhelming
misfortunes are the surest test of manhood.
How high a person bears up his head under
the blows of fate is the best gage of his stature.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>
But Strindberg, in spite of his colossal physique,
was not cast in the heroic mold. The breakdown
of his fortunes caused him to turn traitor to himself,
to recant and destroy his intellectual past.</p>

<p>Whether he was actually insane is a question for
psychiaters to settle; normal he certainly was not.
In medical opinion his modes of reacting to the
obstructions and difficulties of the daily life were
conclusively symptomatic of neurasthenia. Certain
obsessive ideas and idiosyncracies of his,
closely bordering upon phobia, would seem to indicate
grave psychic disorder. His temper and
his world-view were indicative of hypochondria:
he perceived only the hostile, never the friendly,
aspects of events, people, and phenomena. Dejectedly
he declares: &ldquo;There is falseness even in
the calm air and the sunshine, and I feel that happiness
has no place in my lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Destiny had assembled within him all the doubts
and pangs of the modern soul, but had neglected
to counterpoise them with positive and constructive
convictions; so that when his small store of hopes
and prospects was exhausted, he broke down from
sheer hollowness of heart. He died a recluse, a
penitent, and a renegade to all his past ideas and
persuasions.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>Evidently, with his large assortment of defects
both of character and of intellect, Strindberg
could not be classed as one of the great constructive
minds of our period. Viewed in his social
importance, he will interest future students of
morals chiefly as an agitator, a polemist, and in
a fashion, too, as a prophet; by his uniquely aggressive
veracity, he rendered a measure of valuable
service to his time.</p>

<p>But viewed as a creative writer, both of drama
and fiction, he has an incontestable claim to our
lasting attention. His work shows artistic ability,
even though it rarely attains to greatness and is
frequently marred by the bizarre qualities of his
style. Presumably his will be a permanent place
in the history of literature, principally because of
the extraordinary subjective animation of his work.
And perhaps in times less depressed than ours
its gloominess may act as a valuable antidote upon
the popular prejudice against being serious. His
artistic profession of faith certainly should save
him from wholesale condemnation. He says in
one of his prefaces: &ldquo;Some people have accused
my tragedy of being too sad, as though one desired
a merry tragedy. People clamor for Enjoyment
as though Enjoyment consisted in being
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>
foolish. I find enjoyment in the powerful and
terrible struggles of life; and the capability of
experiencing something, of learning something,
gives me pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The keynote to his literary productions is the
cry of the agony of being. Every line of his
works is written in the shadow of the sorrow of
living. In them, all that is most dismal and terrifying
and therefore most tragical, becomes articulate.
They are propelled by an abysmal pessimism,
and because of this fact, since pessimism is
one of the mightiest inspiring forces in literature,
August Strindberg, its foremost spokesman, deserves
to be read and understood.

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>III<br/>
<small>THE EXALTATION OF FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE</small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> these embattled times it is perfectly natural
to expect from any discourse on Nietzsche's
philosophy first of all a statement concerning
the relation of that troublesome genius to the
origins of the war; and this demand prompts a few
candid words on that aspect of the subject at the
start.</p>

<p>For more than three years the public has been
persistently taught by the press to think of Friedrich
Nietzsche mainly as the powerful promoter
of a systematic national movement of the German
people for the conquest of the world. But there
is strong and definite internal evidence in the writings
of Nietzsche against the assumption that he
intentionally aroused a spirit of war or aimed in
any way at the world-wide preponderance of Germany's
type of civilization. Nietzsche had a temperamental
loathing for everything that is brutal,
a loathing which was greatly intensified by his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>
personal contact with the horrors of war while
serving as a military nurse in the campaign of
1870. If there were still any one senseless enough
to plead the erstwhile popular cause of Pan-Germanism,
he would be likely to find more support
for his argument in the writings of the de-<ins title="gallisized">gallicized</ins>
Frenchman, Count Joseph Arthur Gobineau,
or of the germanized Englishman, Houston
Stewart Chamberlain, than in those of the &ldquo;hermit
of Maria-Sils,&rdquo; who does not even suggest, let
alone advocate, German world-predominance in
a single line of all his writings. To couple Friedrich
Nietzsche with Heinrich von Treitschke as
the latter's fellow herald of German ascendancy
is truly preposterous. Treitschke himself was bitterly
and irreconcilably set against the creator of
Zarathustra,<a name="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">(14)</a> in whom ever since &ldquo;Unzeitgemässe
Betrachtungen&rdquo; he had divined &ldquo;the good European,&rdquo;&mdash;which
to the author of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche
Geschichte</i> meant the bad Prussian, and by consequence
the bad German.</p>

<p>As a consummate individualist and by the same
token a cosmopolite to the full, Nietzsche was the
last remove from national, or strictly speaking
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>
even from racial, jingoism. Even the imputation
of ordinary patriotic sentiments would have been
resented by him as an insult, for such sentiments
were to him a sure symptom of that gregarious
disposition which was so utterly abhorrent to his
feelings. In his German citizenhood he took no
pride whatsoever. On every occasion that offered
he vented in mordant terms his contempt for the
country of his birth, boastfully proclaiming his own
derivation from alien stock. He bemoaned his
fate of having to write for Germans; averring
that people who drank beer and smoked pipes
were hopelessly incapable of understanding him.
Of this extravagance in denouncing his countrymen
the following account by one of his keenest American
interpreters gives a fair idea. &ldquo;No epithet
was too outrageous, no charge was too farfetched,
no manipulation or interpretation of evidence was
too daring to enter into his ferocious indictment.
He accused the Germans of stupidity, superstitiousness,
and silliness; of a chronic weakness of
dodging issues, a fatuous &lsquo;barn-yard&rsquo; and &lsquo;green-pasture&rsquo;
contentment, of yielding supinely to the
commands and exactions of a clumsy and unintelligent
government; of degrading education to the
low level of mere cramming and examination passing;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>
of a congenital inability to understand and absorb
the culture of other peoples, and particularly
the culture of the French; of a boorish bumptiousness,
and an ignorant, ostrichlike complacency; of
a systematic hostility to men of genius, whether
in art, science, or philosophy; of a slavish devotion
to the two great European narcotics, alcohol
and Christianity; of a profound beeriness, a spiritual
dyspepsia, a puerile mysticism, an old-womanish
pettiness, and an ineradicable liking for the
obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and shrouded.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">(15)</a>
It certainly requires a violent twist of logic
to hold this catalogue of invectives responsible for
the transformation of a sluggish and indolent
bourgeoisie into a &ldquo;Volk in Waffen&rdquo; unified by an
indomitable and truculent rapacity.</p>

<p>Neither should Nietzsche's general condemnation
of mild and tender forbearance&mdash;on the
ground that it blocks the purpose of nature&mdash;be interpreted
as a call to universal militancy. By his
ruling it is only supermen that are privileged to
carry their will through. But undeniably he
does teach that the world belongs to the strong.
They may grab it at any temporary loss to the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
common run of humanity and, if need be, with
sanguinary force, since their will is, ulteriorly,
identical with the cosmic purpose.</p>

<p>Of course this is preaching war of some sort,
but Nietzsche was not in favor of war on ethnic
or ethical grounds, like that fanatical militarist,
General von Bernhardi, whom the great mass of
his countrymen in the time before the war would
have bluntly rejected as their spokesman. Anyway,
Nietzsche did not mean to encourage Germany
to subjugate the rest of the world. He even
deprecated her victory in the bloody contest of
1870, because he thought that it had brought on
a form of material prosperity of which internal
decay and the collapse of intellectual and spiritual
ideals were the unfortunate concomitants. At the
same time, the universal <ins title="decreptitude">decrepitude</ins> prevented
the despiser of his own people from conceiving a
decided preference for some other country. He
held that all European nations were progressing
in the wrong direction,&mdash;the deadweight of exaggerated
and misshapen materialism dragged them
back and down. English life he deemed almost
irredeemably clogged by utilitarianism. Even
France, the only modern commonwealth credited
by Nietzsche with an indigenous culture, was governed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>
by what he stigmatizes as the life philosophy
of the shopkeeper. Nietzsche is destitute of national
ideals. In fact he never thinks in terms of
politics. He aims to be &ldquo;a good European, not a
good German.&rdquo; In his aversion to the extant
order of society he never for a moment advocates,
like Rousseau or Tolstoy, a breach with civilization.
Cataclysmic changes through anarchy, revolution,
and war were repugnant to his ideals of
culture. For two thousand years the races of
Europe had toiled to humanize themselves, school
their character, equip their minds, refine their
tastes. Could any sane reformer have calmly contemplated
the possible engulfment in another
Saturnian age of the gains purchased by that
enormous expenditure of human labor? According
to Nietzsche's conviction, the new dispensation
could not be entered in a book of blank pages. A
higher civilization could only be reared upon a
lower. So it seems that he is quite wrongly accused
of having been an &ldquo;accessory before the
deed,&rdquo; in any literal or legal sense, to the stupendous
international struggle witnessed to-day. And
we may pass on to consider in what other way he
was a vital factor of modern social development.
For whatever we may think of the political value
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>
of his teachings, it is impossible to deny their
arousing and inspiriting effect upon the intellectual,
moral, and artistic faculties of his epoch and ours.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>It should be clearly understood that the significance
of Nietzsche for our age is not to be explained
by any weighty discovery in the realm of
knowledge. Nietzsche's merit consists not in any
unriddling of the universe by a metaphysical key
to its secrets, but rather in the diffusion of a new
intellectual light elucidating human consciousness
in regard to the purpose and the end of existence.
Nietzsche has no objective truths to teach, indeed
he acknowledges no truth other than subjective.
Nor does he put any faith in bare logic, but on
the contrary pronounces it one of mankind's greatest
misfortunes. His argumentation is not sustained
and progressive, but desultory, impressionistic,
and freely repetitional; slashing aphorism
is its most effective tool. And so, in the sense of
the schools, he is not a philosopher at all; quite
the contrary, an implacable enemy of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</i>.
And yet the formative and directive influence of
his vaticinations, enunciated with tremendous
spiritual heat and lofty gesture, has been very
great. His conception of life has acted upon the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
generation as a moral intoxicant of truly incalculable
strength.</p>

<p>Withal his published work, amounting to eighteen
volumes, though flagrantly irrational, yet
does contain a perfectly coherent doctrine. Only,
it is a doctrine to whose core mere peripheric
groping will never negotiate the approach. Its essence
must be caught by flashlike seizure and cannot
be conveyed except to minds of more than the
average imaginative sensibility. For its central
ideas relate to the remotest ultimates, and its
dominant prepossession, the <em>Overman</em>, is, in the
final reckoning, the creature of a Utopian fancy.
To be more precise, Nietzsche extorts from the
Darwinian theory of selection a set of amazing
connotations by means of the simultaneous shift
from the biological to the poetic sphere of thought
and from the averagely socialized to an uncompromisingly
self-centred attitude of mind. This
doubly eccentric position is rendered feasible for
him by a whole-souled indifference to exact science
and an intense contempt for the practical adjustments
of life. He is, first and last, an imaginative
schemer, whose visions are engendered by inner
exuberance; the propelling power of his philosophy
being an intense temperamental enthusiasm
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
at one and the same time lyrically sensitive and
dramatically impassioned. It is these qualities of
soul that made his utterance ring with the force of
a high moral challenge. All the same, he was not
any more original in his ethics than in his theory
of knowledge. In this field also his receptive
mind threw itself wide open to the flow of older
influences which it encountered. The religion of
personal advantage had had many a prophet before
Nietzsche. Among the older writers, Machiavelli
was its weightiest champion. In Germany,
Nietzsche's immediate predecessor was
&ldquo;Max Stirner,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">(16)</a> and as regards foreign thinkers,
Nietzsche declared as late as 1888 that to no
other writer of his own century did he feel himself
so closely allied by the ties of congeniality as to
Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p>

<p>The most superficial acquaintance with these
writers shows that Nietzsche is held responsible
for certain revolutionary notions of which he
by no means was the originator. Of the connection
of his doctrine with the maxims of &ldquo;The
Prince&rdquo; and of &ldquo;The Ego and His Own&rdquo; (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der
Einzige und sein Eigentum</i>)<a name="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">(17)</a> nothing further need
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>
be said than that to them Nietzsche owes, directly
or indirectly, the principle of &ldquo;non-morality.&rdquo;
However, he does not employ the same strictly intellectual
methods. They were logicians rather
than moralists, and their ruler-man is in the main a
construction of cold reasoning, while the ruler-man
of Nietzsche is the vision of a genius whose
eye looks down a much longer perspective than
is accorded to ordinary mortals. That a far
greater affinity of temper should have existed between
Nietzsche and Emerson than between him
and the two classic non-moralists, must bring surprise
to the many who have never recognized the
Concord Sage as an exponent of unfettered individualism.
Yet in fact Emerson goes to such an
extreme of individualism that the only thing that
has saved his memory from anathema is that he
has not many readers in his after-times, and these
few do not always venture to understand him. And
Emerson, though in a different way from Nietzsche's,
was also a rhapsodist. In his poetry, where
he articulates his meaning with far greater unrestraint
than in his prose, we find without any difficulty
full corroboration of his spiritual kinship
with Nietzsche. For instance, where may we turn
in the works of the latter for a stronger statement
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>
of the case of Power versus Pity than is contained
in &ldquo;The World Soul&rdquo;?</p>

<div class="poetry width17">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">&ldquo;He serveth the servant,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">The brave he loves amain,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">He kills the cripple and the sick,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">And straight begins again;<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">For gods delight in gods,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">And thrust the weak aside,&mdash;<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">To him who scorns their charities<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">Their arms fly open wide.&rdquo;<br/></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">From such a world-view what moral could proceed
more logically than that of Zarathustra:
&ldquo;And him whom ye do not teach to fly, teach&mdash;how
to fall quicker&rdquo;?</p>

<p>But after all, the intellectual origin of Nietzsche's
ideas matters but little. Wheresoever they
were derived from, he made them strikingly his
own by raising them to the splendid elevation of
his thought. And if nevertheless he has failed to
take high rank and standing among the sages of
the schools, this shortage in his professional prestige
is more than counterbalanced by the wide
reach of his influence among the laity. What
might the re-classification, or perchance even the
re-interpretation, of known facts about life have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>
signified beside Nietzsche's lofty apprehension of
the sacredness of life itself? For whatever may
be the social menace of his reasoning, his commanding
proclamation to an expectant age of the
doctrine that Progress means infinite growth towards
ideals of perfection has resulted in a singular
reanimation of the individual sense of dignity,
served as a potent remedy of social dry-rot, and
furthered our gradual emergence from the impenetrable
darkness of ancestral traditions.</p>

<p>In seeking an adequate explanation of his power
over modern minds we readily surmise that his
philosophy draws much of its vitality from the
system of science that underlies it. And yet while
it is true enough that Nietzsche's fundamental
thesis is an offshoot of the Darwinian theory, the
violent individualism which is the driving principle
of his entire philosophy is rather opposed to
the general orientation of Darwinism, since that
is social. Not to the author of the &ldquo;Descent of
Man&rdquo; directly is the modern ethical glorification
of egoism indebted for its measure of scientific
sanction, but to one of his heterodox disciples,
namely to the bio-philosopher W.&nbsp;H. Rolph, who
in a volume named &ldquo;Biologic Problems,&rdquo; with the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>
subtitle, &ldquo;An Essay in Rational Ethics,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">(18)</a> deals
definitely with the problem of evolution in its
dynamical bearings. The question is raised, Why
do the extant types of life ascend toward higher
goals, and, on reaching them, progress toward still
higher goals, to the end of time? Under the reason
as explained by Darwin, should not evolution
stop at a definite stage, namely, when the object of
the competitive struggle for existence has been
fully attained? Self-preservation naturally ceases
to act as an incentive to further progress, so soon
as the weaker contestants are beaten off the field
and the survival of the fittest is abundantly secured.
From there on we have to look farther for
an adequate causation of the ascent of species.
Unless we assume the existence of an absolutistic
teleological tendency to perfection, we are logically
bound to connect upward development with favorable
external conditions. By substituting for
the Darwinian &ldquo;struggle for existence&rdquo; a new formula:
&ldquo;struggle for surplus,&rdquo; Rolph advances a
new fruitful hypothesis. In all creatures the acquisitive
cravings exceed the limit of actual necessity.
Under Darwin's interpretation of nature,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>
the struggle between individuals of the same species
would give way to pacific equilibrium as soon
as the bare subsistence were no longer in question.
Yet we know that the struggle is unending. The
creature appetites are not appeased by a normal
sufficiency; on the contrary, &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'appetit vient en
mangeant</i>&rdquo;; the possessive instinct, if not quite insatiable,
is at least coextensive with its opportunities
for gratification. Whether or not it be true&mdash;as
Carlyle claims&mdash;that, after all, the fundamental
question between any two human beings is,
&ldquo;Can I kill thee, or canst thou kill me?&rdquo;&mdash;at any
rate in civilized human society the contest is not
waged merely for the naked existence, but mainly
for life's increments in the form of comforts,
pleasures, luxuries, and the accumulation of power
and influence; and the excess of acquisition over
immediate need goes as a residuum into the structure
of civilization. In plain words, then, social
progress is pushed on by individual greed and
ambition. At this point Rolph rests the case, without
entering into the moral implicates of the subject,
which would seem to obtrude themselves upon
the attention.</p>

<p>Now to a believer in progressive evolution with
a strong ethical bent such a theory brings home
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>
man's ulterior responsibility for the betterment of
life, and therefore acts as a call to his supreme
duty of preparing the ground for the arrival of
a higher order of beings. The argument seems
simple and clinching. Living nature through a
long file of species and genera has at last worked
up to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo sapiens</i> who as yet does not even
approach the perfection of his own type. Is it a
legitimate ambition of the race to mark time on
the stand which it has reached and to entrench
itself impregnably in its present mediocrity?
Nietzsche did not shrink from any of the inferential
conclusions logically to be drawn from the
biologic argument. If growth is in the purpose of
nature, then once we have accepted our chief office
in life, it becomes our task to pave the way for a
higher genus of man. And the only force that
makes with directness for that object is the Will
to Power. To foreshadow the resultant human
type, Nietzsche resurrected from Goethe's vocabulary
the convenient word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Übermensch</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Overman.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Any one regarding existence in the light of a
stern and perpetual combat is of necessity driven
at last to the alternative between making the best
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>
of life and making an end of it; he must either
seek lasting deliverance from the evil of living or
endeavor to wrest from the world by any means
at his command the greatest sum of its gratifications.
It is serviceable to describe the two frames
of mind respectively as the optimistic and the
pessimistic. But it would perhaps be hasty to conclude
that the first of these attitudes necessarily
betokens the greater strength of character.</p>

<p>Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy sprang from
pessimism, yet issued in an optimism of unheard-of
exaltation; carrying, however, to the end its
plainly visible birthmarks. He started out as an
enthusiastic disciple of Arthur Schopenhauer; unquestionably
the adherence was fixed by his own
deep-seated contempt for the complacency of the
plebs. But he was bound soon to part company
with the grandmaster of pessimism, because he
discovered the root of the philosophy of renunciation
in that same detestable debility of the will
which he deemed responsible for the bovine lassitude
of the masses; both pessimism and philistinism
came from a lack of vitality, and were symptoms
of racial degeneracy. But before Nietzsche
finally rejected Schopenhauer and gave his shocking
counterblast to the undermining action of pessimism,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
he succumbed temporarily to the spell of
another gigantic personality. We are not concerned
with Richard Wagner's musical influence
upon Nietzsche, who was himself a musician of no
mean ability; what is to the point here is the
prime principle of Wagner's art theory. The key
to the Wagnerian theory is found, also, in Schopenhauer's
philosophy. Wagner starts from the
pessimistic thesis that at the bottom of the well of
life lies nothing but suffering,&mdash;hence living is utterly
undesirable. In one of his letters to Franz
Liszt he names as the duplex root of his creative
genius the longing for love and the yearning for
death. On another occasion, he confesses his own
emotional nihilism in the following summary of
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tristan und Isolde</i>: &ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sehnsucht, Sehnsucht, unstillbares,
ewig neu sich gebärendes Verlangen&mdash;Schmachten
und Dursten; einzige Erlösung: Tod,
Sterben, Untergehen,&mdash;Nichtmehrerwachen.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">(19)</a>
But from the boundless ocean of sorrow there is
a refuge. It was Wagner's fundamental dogma
that through the illusions of art the individual is
enabled to rise above the hopelessness of the realities
into a new cosmos replete with supreme satisfactions.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
Man's mundane salvation therefore depends
upon the ministrations of art and his own
artistic sensitiveness. The glorification of genius
is a natural corollary of such a belief.</p>

<p>Nietzsche in one of his earliest works examines
Wagner's theory and amplifies it by a rather casuistic
interpretation of the evolution of art. After
raising the question, How did the Greeks contrive
to dignify and ennoble their national existence?
he points, by way of an illustrative answer, not
perchance to the Periclean era, but to a far more
primitive epoch of Hellenic culture, when a total
oblivion of the actual world and a transport into
the realm of imagination was universally possible.
He explains the trance as the effect of intoxication,&mdash;primarily
in the current literal sense of
the word. Such was the significance of the cult of
Dionysos. &ldquo;Through singing and dancing,&rdquo; claims
Nietzsche, &ldquo;man manifests himself as member of
a higher community. Walking and talking he has
unlearned, and is in a fair way to dance up into
the air.&rdquo; That this supposititious Dionysiac phase
of Hellenic culture was in turn succeeded by more
rational stages, in which the impulsive flow of life
was curbed and dammed in by operations of the
intellect, is not permitted by Nietzsche to invalidate
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
the argument. By his arbitrary reading of
ancient history he was, at first, disposed to look to
the forthcoming <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Universal-Kunstwerk</i><a name="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">(20)</a> as the
complete expression of a new religious spirit and
as the adequate lever of a general uplift of mankind
to a state of bliss. But the typical disparity
between Wagner and Nietzsche was bound to
alienate them. Wagner, despite all appearance to
the contrary, is inherently democratic in his convictions,&mdash;his
earlier political vicissitudes amply
confirm this view,&mdash;and fastens his hope for the
elevation of humanity through art upon the sort
of genius in whom latent popular forces might
combine to a new summit. Nietzsche on the other
hand represents the extreme aristocratic type, both
in respect of thought and of sentiment. &ldquo;I do not
wish to be confounded with and mistaken for these
preachers of equality,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;For within <em>me</em>
justice saith: men are not equal.&rdquo; His ideal is
a hero of coercive personality, dwelling aloft in
solitude, despotically bending the gregarious instincts
of the common crowd to his own higher
purposes by the dominating force of his Will to
Might.</p>

<p>The concept of the Overman rests, as has been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
shown, upon a fairly solid substructure of plausibility,
since at the bottom of the author's reasoning
lies the notion that mankind is destined to outgrow
its current status; the thought of a humanity
risen to new and wondrous heights of power over
nature is not necessarily unscientific for being supremely
imaginative. The Overman, however,
cannot be produced ready made, by any instantaneous
process; he must be slowly and persistently
willed into being, through love of the new ideal
which he is to embody: &ldquo;All great Love,&rdquo; speaketh
Zarathustra, &ldquo;seeketh to create what it loveth.
<em>Myself</em> I sacrifice into my love, and <em>my neighbor</em>
as myself, thus runneth the speech of all creators.&rdquo;
Only the fixed conjoint purpose of many generations
of aspiring men will be able to create the
Overman. &ldquo;Could you create a God?&mdash;Then be
silent concerning all gods! But ye could very well
create Beyond-man. Not yourselves perhaps, my
brethren! But ye could create yourselves into
fathers and fore-fathers of Beyond-man; and let
this be your best creating. But all creators are
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nietzsche's startlingly heterodox code of ethics
coheres organically with the Overman hypothesis,
and so understood is certain to lose some of its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
aspect of absurdity. The racial will, as we have
seen, must be taught to aim at the Overman. But
the volitional faculty of the generation, according
to Nietzsche, is so debilitated as to be utterly inadequate
to its office. Hence, advisedly to stimulate
and strengthen the enfeebled will power of his
fellow men is the most imperative and immediate
task of the radical reformer. Once the power of
willing, as such, shall have been,&mdash;regardless of
the worthiness of its object,&mdash;brought back to active
life, it will be feasible to give the Will to
Might a direction towards objects of the highest
moral grandeur.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the race as a whole, the
throng is ineligible for partnership in the auspicious
scheme of co-operative procreation: which
fact necessitates a segregative method of breeding.
The Overman can only be evolved by an ancestry
of master-men, who must be secured to the race
by a rigid application of eugenic standards, particularly
in the matter of mating. Of marriage,
Nietzsche has this definition: &ldquo;Marriage, so call
I the will of two to create one who is more than
they who created him.&rdquo; For the bracing of the
weakened will-force of the human breed it is absolutely
essential that master-men, the potential progenitors
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>
of the superman, be left unhampered to
the impulse of &ldquo;living themselves out&rdquo; (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">sich auszuleben</i>),&mdash;an
opportunity of which under the regnant
code of morals they are inconsiderately deprived.
Since, then, existing dictates and conventions
are a serious hindrance to the requisite autonomy
of the master-man, their abolishment
might be well. Yet on the other hand, it is convenient
that the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vielzuviele</i>, the &ldquo;much-too-many,&rdquo;
i.&nbsp;e. the despised generality of people,
should continue to be governed and controlled by
strict rules and regulations, so that the will of the
master-folk might the more expeditiously be
wrought. Would it not, then, be an efficacious
compromise to keep the canon of morality in force
for the general run, but suspend it for the special
benefit of master-men, prospective or full-fledged?
From the history of the race Nietzsche draws a
warrant for the distinction. His contention is that
masters and slaves have never lived up to a single
code of conduct. Have not civilizations risen and
fallen according as they were shaped by this
or that class of nations? History also teaches
what disastrous consequences follow the loss of
caste. In the case of the Jewish people, the
domineering type or morals gave way to the servile
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
as a result of the Babylonian captivity. So long
as the Jews were strong, they extolled all manifestations
of strength and energy. The collapse
of their own strength turned them into apologists
of the so-called &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; of humility, long-suffering,
forgiveness,&mdash;until, according to the Judæo-Christian
code of ethics, being good came to mean
being weak. So races may justly be classified into
masters and slaves, and history proves that to the
strong goes the empire. The ambitions of a nation
are a sure criterion of its worth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walk through these folk and keep mine eyes open.
They have become <em>smaller</em> and are becoming ever smaller.

virtue.</em></p>

<p>For they are modest even in their virtue; for they are
desirous of ease. But with ease only modest virtue is
compatible.</p>

<p>True, in their fashion they learn how to stride and to
stride forward. That I call their <em>hobbling</em>. Thereby
they become an offense unto every one who is in a hurry.</p>

backward, with a stiffened neck. I rejoice to run against
the stomachs of such.</p>

<p>Foot and eyes shall not lie, nor reproach each other

genuine actors.</p>

<p>Here is little of man; therefore women try to make
themselves manly. For only he who is enough of a man
will save the woman in woman.</p>

<p>And this hypocrisy I found to be worst among them,
that even those who command feign the virtues of those
who serve.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I serve, thou servest, we serve.&rsquo; Thus the hypocrisy
of the rulers prayeth. And, alas, if the highest lord be

<p>The only law acknowledged by him who would
be a master is the bidding of his own will. He
makes short work of every other law. Whatever
clogs the flight of his indomitable ambition must
be ruthlessly swept aside. Obviously, the enactment
of this law that would render the individual
supreme and absolute would strike the death-knell
for all established forms and institutions of the
social body. But such is quite within Nietzsche's
intention. They are noxious agencies, ingeniously
devised for the enslavement of the will, and the
most pernicious among them is the Christian religion,
because of the alleged divine sanction conferred
by it upon subserviency. Christianity
would thwart the supreme will of nature by curbing
that lust for domination which the laws of
nature as revealed by science sanction, nay prescribe.
Nietzsche's ideas on this subject are loudly
and over-loudly voiced in <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Antichrist</i> (&ldquo;The
Anti-Christ&rdquo;), written in September 1888 as the
first part of a planned treatise in four instalments,
entitled <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Wille zur Macht. Versuch einer
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>
Umwertung aller Werte</i>. (&ldquo;The Will to Power.
An Attempted Transvaluation of All Values&rdquo;.)</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The master-man's will, then, is his only law.
That is the essence of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herrenmoral</i>. And so the
question arises, Whence shall the conscience of the
ruler-man derive its distinctions between the Right
and the Wrong? The arch-iconoclast brusquely
stifles this naïve query beforehand by assuring us
that such distinctions in their accepted sense do
not exist for personages of that grander stamp.
Heedless of the time-hallowed concepts that all
men share in common, he enjoins mastermen to
take their position uncompromisingly outside the
confining area of conventions, in the moral independence
that dwells &ldquo;beyond good and evil.&rdquo;
Good and Evil are mere denotations, devoid of
any real significance. Right and Wrong are not
ideals immutable through the ages, nor even the
same at any time in all states of society. They
are vague and general notions, varying more or
less with the practical exigencies under which they
were conceived. What was right for my great-grandfather
is not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> right for myself.
Hence, the older and better established a law, the
more inapposite is it apt to be to the living demands.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
Why should the ruler-man bow down to
outworn statutes or stultify his self-dependent
moral sense before the artificial and stupidly uniform
moral relics of the dead past? Good is
whatever conduces to the increase of my power,&mdash;evil
is whatever tends to diminish it! Only the
weakling and the hypocrite will disagree.</p>

<p>Unmistakably this is a straightout application
of the &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; criterion of truth. Nietzsche's
unconfessed and cautious imitators, who
call themselves pragmatists, are not bold enough
to follow their own logic from the cognitive sphere
to the moral. They stop short of the natural
conclusion to which their own premises lead. Morality
is necessarily predicated upon specific notions
of truth. So if Truth is an alterable and
shifting concept, must not morality likewise be
variable? The pragmatist might just as well come
out at once into the broad light and frankly say:
&ldquo;Laws do not interest me in the abstract, or for
the sake of their general beneficence; they interest
me only in so far as they affect me. Therefore I
will make, interpret, and abolish them to suit myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Nietzsche the &ldquo;quest of truth&rdquo; is a palpable
evasion. Truth is merely a means for the enhancement
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>
of my subjective satisfaction. It makes
not a whit of difference whether an opinion or a
judgment satisfies this or that scholastic definition.
I call true and good that which furthers
my welfare and intensifies my joy in living; and,&mdash;to
vindicate my self-gratification as a form, indeed
the highest, of &ldquo;social service,&rdquo;&mdash;the desirable
thing is that which matters for the improvement
of the human stock and thereby speeds the advent
of the Superman. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaims Zarathustra,
&ldquo;that ye would understand my word: Be sure to
do whatever ye like,&mdash;but first of all be such as
<em>can will</em>! Be sure to love your neighbor as yourself,&mdash;but
first of all be such as <em>love themselves</em>,&mdash;as
love themselves with great love, with contempt.
Thus speaketh Zarathustra, the ungodly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By way of throwing some light upon this phase
of Nietzsche's moral philosophy, it may be added
that ever since 1876 he was an assiduous student
of Herbert Spencer, with whose theory of social
evolution he was first made acquainted by his
friend, Paul Rée, who in two works of his own,
&ldquo;Psychologic Observations,&rdquo; (1875), and &ldquo;On
the Origin of Moral Sentiments,&rdquo; (1877), had
elaborated upon the Spencerian theory about the
genealogy of morals.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>The best known among all of Nietzsche's works,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Also Sprach Zarathustra</i> (&ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;),
is the Magna Charta of the new moral
emancipation. It was composed during a sojourn
in southern climes between 1883 and 1885, during
the convalescence from a nervous collapse, when
after a long and critical depression his spirit was
recovering its accustomed resilience. Nietzsche
wrote his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum opus</i> in solitude, in the mountains
and by the sea. His mind always was at its
best in settings of vast proportions, and in this
particular work there breathes an exaltation that
has scarcely its equal in the world's literature.
Style and diction in their supreme elation suit the
lofty fervor of the sentiment. From the feelings,
as a fact, this great rhapsody flows, and to the
feelings it makes its appeal; its extreme fascination
must be lost upon those who only know how to
&ldquo;listen to reason.&rdquo; The wondrous plastic beauty
of the language, along with the high emotional
pitch of its message, render &ldquo;Zarathustra&rdquo; a priceless
poetic monument; indeed its practical effect
in chastening and rejuvenating German literary
diction can hardly be overestimated. Its value as
a philosophic document is much slighter. It is
not even organized on severely logical lines. On
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>
the contrary, the four component parts are but
brilliant variations upon a single generic theme,
each in a different clef, but harmoniously united
by the incremental ecstasy of the movement. The
composition is free from monotony, for down to
each separate aphorism every part of it has its
special lyric nuance. The whole purports to
convey in the form of discourse the prophetic
message of Zarathustra, the hermit sage, an idealized
self-portrayal of the author.</p>

<p>In the first book the tone is calm and temperate.
Zarathustra exhorts and instructs his disciples,
rails at his adversaries, and discloses his
superiority over them. In the soliloquies and dialogues
of the second book he reveals himself more
fully and freely as the Superman. The third book
contains the meditations and rhapsodies of Zarathustra
now dwelling wholly apart from men, his
mind solely occupied with thought about the
Eternal Return of the Present. In the fourth book
he is found in the company of a few chosen spirits
whom he seeks to imbue with his perfected doctrine.
In this final section of the work the deep
lyric current is already on the ebb; it is largely
supplanted by irony, satire, sarcasm, even buffoonery,
all of which are resorted to for the pitiless
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>
excoriation of our type of humanity, deemed decrepit
by the Sage. The author's intention to
present in a concluding fifth division the dying
Zarathustra pronouncing his benedictions upon
life in the act of quitting it was not to bear fruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zarathustra&rdquo;&mdash;Nietzsche's terrific assault
upon the fortifications of our social structure&mdash;is
too easily mistaken by facile cavilers for the ravings
of an unsound and desperate mind. To a narrow
and superficial reading, it exhibits itself as a
wholesale repudiation of all moral responsibility
and a maniacal attempt to subvert human civilization
for the exclusive benefit of the &ldquo;glorious
blonde brute, rampant with greed for victory and
spoil.&rdquo; Yet those who care to look more deeply
will detect beneath this chimerical contempt of
conventional regulations no want of a highminded
philanthropic purpose, provided they have the vision
necessary to comprehend a love of man oriented
by such extremely distant perspectives. At all
events they will discover that in this rebellious
propaganda an advancing line of life is firmly
traced out. The indolent and thoughtless may indeed
be horrified by the appalling dangers of the
gospel according to Zarathustra. But in reality
there is no great cause for alarm. Society may
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>
amply rely upon its agencies, even in these stupendous
times of universal war, for protection
from any disastrous organic dislocations incited
by the teachings of Zarathustra, at least so far as
the immediate future is concerned&mdash;in which alone
society appears to be interested. Moreover, our
apprehensions are appeased by the sober reflection
that by its plain unfeasibleness the whole supersocial
scheme of Nietzsche is reduced to colossal
absurdity. Its limitless audacity defeats any formulation
of its &ldquo;war aims.&rdquo; For what compels
an ambitious imagination to arrest itself at the
goal of the superman? Why should it not run on
beyond that first terminal? In one of Mr. G.&nbsp;K.
Chesterton's labored extravaganzas a grotesque
sort of super-overman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in spe</i> succeeds in going beyond
unreason when he contrives this lucid self-definition:
&ldquo;I have gone where God has never
dared to go. I am above the silly supermen as
they are above mere men. Where I walk in the
Heavens, no man has walked before me, and I
am alone in a garden.&rdquo; It is enough to make one
gasp and then perhaps luckily recall Goethe's consoling
thought that under the care of Providence
the trees will not grow into the heavens. (&ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es ist
dafür gesorgt, dass die Bäume nicht in den Himmel
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141"> </a>
wachsen.</i>&rdquo;) As matter of fact, the ideas promulgated
in <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Also Sprach Zarathustra</i> need inspire
no fear of their winning the human race from its
venerable idols, despite the fact that the pull of
natural laws and of elemental appetites seems to
be on their side. The only effect to be expected
of such a philosophy is that it will act as an antidote
for moral inertia which inevitably goes with
the flock-instinct and the lazy reliance on the accustomed
order of things.</p>

<p>Nietzsche's ethics are not easy to valuate, since
none of their standards are derived from the orthodox
canon. His being a truly personalized
form of morality, his principles are strictly cognate
to his temperament. To his professed ideals
there attaches a definite theory of society. And
since his philosophy is consistent in its sincerity,
its message is withheld from the man-in-the-street,
deemed unworthy of notice, and delivered only to
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> that shall beget the superman. To
Nietzsche the good of the greatest number is no
valid consideration. The great stupid mass exists
only for the sake of an oligarchy by whom it is
duly exploited under nature's decree that the
strong shall prey upon the weak. Let, then, this
favored set further the design of nature by systematically
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>
encouraging the elevation of their own
type.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>We have sought to dispel the fiction about the
shaping influence of Nietzsche upon the thought
and conduct of his nation, and have accounted for
the miscarriage of his ethics by their fantastic
impracticability. Yet it has been shown also that
he fostered in an unmistakable fashion the class-consciousness
of the aristocrat, born or self-appointed.
To that extent his influence was certainly
malign. Yet doubtless he did perform a
service to our age. The specific nature of this
service, stated in the fewest words, is that to his
great divinatory gift are we indebted for an unprecedented
strengthening of our hold upon reality.
In order to make this point clear we have to
revert once more to Nietzsche's transient intellectual
relation to pessimism.</p>

<p>We have seen that the illusionism of Schopenhauer
and more particularly of Wagner exerted a
strong attraction on his high-strung artistic temperament.</p>

<p>Nevertheless a certain realistic counter-drift to
the ultra-romantic tendency of Wagner's theory
caused him in the long run to reject the faith in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>
the power of Art to save man from evil. Almost
abruptly, his personal affection for the &ldquo;Master,&rdquo;
to whom in his eventual mental eclipse he still
referred tenderly at lucid moments, changed to
bitter hostility. Henceforth he classes the glorification
of Art as one of the three most despicable
attitudes of life: Philistinism, Pietism, and Estheticism,
all of which have their origin in <em>cowardice</em>,
represent three branches of the ignominious
road of escape from the terrors of living. In
three extended diatribes Nietzsche denounces
Wagner as the archetype of modern decadence;
the most violent attack of all is delivered against
the point of juncture in which Wagner's art gospel
and the Christian religion culminate: the promise
of redemption through pity. To Nietzsche's way
of thinking pity is merely the coward's acknowledgment
of his weakness. For only insomuch as a
man is devoid of fortitude in bearing his own sufferings
is he unable to contemplate with equanimity
the sufferings of his fellow creatures. Since
religion enjoins compassion with all forms of human
misery, we should make war upon religion.
And for the reason that Wagner's crowning
achievement, his <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Parsifal</i>, is a veritable sublimation
of Mercy, there can be no truce between its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>
creator and the giver of the counsel: &ldquo;Be hard!&rdquo;
Perhaps this notorious advice is after all not as
ominous as it sounds. It merely expresses rather
abruptly Nietzsche's confidence in the value of self-control
as a means of discipline. If you have
learned calmly to see others suffer, you are yourself
able to endure distress with manful composure.
&ldquo;Therefore I wash the hand which helped
the sufferer; therefore I even wipe my soul.&rdquo; But,
unfortunately, such is the frailty of human nature
that it is only one step from indifference about the
sufferings of others to an inclination to exploit
them or even to inflict pain upon one's neighbors
for the sake of personal gain of one sort or another.</p>

<p>The repudiation of Wagner leaves a tremendous
void in Nietzsche's soul by depriving his enthusiasm
of its foremost concrete object. He loses
his faith in idealism. When illusions can bring a
man like Wagner to such an odious outlook upon
life, they must be obnoxious in themselves; and
so, after being subjected to pitiless analysis, they
are disowned and turned into ridicule. And now,
the pendulum of his zeal having swung from one
emotional extreme to the other, the great rhapsodist
finds himself temporarily destitute of an
adequate theme. However, his fervor does not
long remain in abeyance, and soon it is absorbed
in a new object. Great as is the move it is logical
enough. Since illusions are only a hindrance to
the fuller grasp of life which behooves all free
spirits, Nietzsche energetically turns from self-deception
to its opposite, self-realization. In this
new spiritual endeavor he relies far more on intuition
than on scientific and metaphysical speculation.
From his own stand he is certainly justified
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>
in doing this. Experimentation and ratiocination
at the best are apt to disassociate individual realities
from their complex setting and then proceed
to palm them off as illustrations of life, when in
truth they are lifeless, artificially preserved specimens.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Nietzsche's realism, by contrast, goes to the very
quick of nature, grasps all the gifts of life, and
from the continuous flood of phenomena extracts
a rich, full-flavored essence. It is from a sense of
gratitude for this boon that he becomes an idolatrous
worshiper of experience, &ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">der grosse Jasager</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;the
great sayer of Yes,&mdash;and the most
stimulating optimist of all ages. To Nietzsche
reality is alive as perhaps never to man before.
He plunges down to the very heart of things, absorbs
their vital qualities and meanings, and having
himself learned to draw supreme satisfaction
from the most ordinary facts and events, he makes
the common marvelous to others, which, as was
said by James Russell Lowell, is a true test of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>
genius. No wonder that deification of reality
becomes the dominant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">motif</i> in his philosophy.
But again that onesided aristocratic strain perverts
his ethics. To drain the intoxicating cup
at the feast of life, such is the divine privilege not
of the common run of mortals but only of the elect.
They must not let this or that petty and artificial
convention, nor yet this or that moral command
or prohibition, restrain them from the exercise
of that higher sense of living, but must fully abandon
themselves to its joys. &ldquo;Since man came into
existence he hath had too little joy. That alone,
my brethren, is our original sin.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">(24)</a> The &ldquo;much-too-many&rdquo;
are doomed to inanity by their lack of
appetite at the banquet of life:</p>

are never joyful!<a name="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">(25)</a></p>

<p>The Will to Live holds man's one chance of
this-worldly bliss, and supersedes any care for the
remote felicities of any problematic future state.
Yet the Nietzschean cult of life is not to be understood
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>
by any means as a banal devotion to the
pleasurable side of life alone. The true disciple
finds in every event, be it happy or adverse, exalting
or crushing, the factors of supreme spiritual
satisfaction: joy and pain are equally implied in
experience, the Will to Live encompasses jointly
the capacity to enjoy and to suffer. It may even
be paradoxically said that since man owes some
of his greatest and most beautiful achievements
to sorrow, it must be a joy and a blessing to suffer.
The unmistakable sign of heroism is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amor
fati</i>, a fierce delight in one's destiny, hold what it
may.</p>

<p>Consequently, the precursor of the superman
will be possessed, along with his great sensibility
to pleasure, of a capacious aptitude for suffering.
&ldquo;Ye would perchance abolish suffering,&rdquo; exclaims
Nietzsche, &ldquo;and we,&mdash;it seems that we would
rather have it even greater and worse than it has
ever been. The discipline of suffering,&mdash;tragical
suffering,&mdash;know ye not that only this discipline
has heretofore brought about every elevation of
man?&rdquo; &ldquo;Spirit is that life which cutteth into life.
By one's own pain one's own knowledge increaseth;&mdash;knew
ye that before? And the happiness
of the spirit is this: to be anointed and consecrated
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>
by tears as a sacrificial animal;&mdash;knew
ye that before?&rdquo; And if, then, the tragical pain
inherent in life be no argument against Joyfulness,
the zest of living can be obscured by nothing save
the fear of total extinction. To the disciple of
Nietzsche, by whom every moment of his existence
is realized as a priceless gift, the thought of
his irrevocable separation from all things is unbearable.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Was this life?&rsquo; I shall say to Death.
&lsquo;Well, then, once more!&rsquo;&rdquo; And&mdash;to paraphrase
Nietzsche's own simile&mdash;the insatiable witness of
the great tragi-comedy, spectator and participant
at once, being loath to leave the theatre, and
eager for a repetition of the performance, shouts
his endless <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore</i>, praying fervently that in the
constant repetition of the performance not a single
detail of the action be omitted. The yearning
for the endlessness not of life at large, not of life
on any terms, but of <em>this my life</em> with its ineffable
wealth of rapturous moments, works up the extreme
optimism of Nietzsche to its stupendous
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> notion of infinity, expressed in the name
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die ewige Wiederkehr</i> (&ldquo;Eternal Recurrence&rdquo;).
It is a staggeringly imaginative concept, formed
apart from any evidential grounds, and yet fortified
with a fair amount of logical armament. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>
universe is imagined as endless in time, although
its material contents are not equally conceived as
limitless. Since, consequently, there must be a
limit to the possible variety in the arrangement
and sequence of the sum total of data, even as in
the case of a kaleidoscope, the possibility of variegations
is not infinite. The particular co-ordination
of things in the universe, say at this particular
moment, is bound to recur again and again in the
passing of the eons. But under the nexus of cause
and effect the resurgence of the past from the
ocean of time is not accidental nor is the configuration
of things haphazard, as is true in the case of
the kaleidoscope; rather, history, in the most inclusive
acceptation of the term, is predestined to
repeat itself; this happens through the perpetual
progressive resurrection of its particles. It is then
to be assumed that any aspect which the world has
ever presented must have existed innumerable millions
of times before, and must recur with eternal
periodicity. That the deterministic strain in this
tremendous <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vorstellung</i> of a cyclic rhythm throbbing
in the universe entangles its author's fanatical
belief in evolution in a rather serious self-contradiction,
does not detract from its spiritual lure,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
nor from its wide suggestiveness, however incapable
it may be of scientific demonstration.</p>

<p>From unfathomed depths of feeling wells up
the pæan of the prophet of the life intense.</p>

<p>A timid heart may indeed recoil from the iron
necessity of reliving <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i> its woeful terrestrial
fate. But the prospect can hold no terror
for the heroic soul by whose fiat all items of experience
have assumed important meanings and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>
values. He who has cast in his lot with Destiny
in spontaneous submission to all its designs, cannot
but revere and cherish his own fate as an integral
part of the grand unalterable fatality of
things.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>If this crude presentment of Friedrich Nietzsche's
doctrine has not entirely failed of its purpose,
the <i>leitmotifs</i> of that doctrine will have been
readily referred by the reader to their origin; they
can be subsumed under that temperamental category
which is more or less accurately defined as
the <em>romantic</em>. Glorification of violent passion,&mdash;quest
of innermost mysteries,&mdash;boundless expansion
of self-consciousness,&mdash;visions of a future of
transcendent magnificence, and notwithstanding
an ardent worship of reality a quixotically impracticable
detachment from the concrete basis
of civic life,&mdash;these outstanding characteristics of
the Nietzschean philosophy give unmistakable
proof of a central, driving, romantic inspiration:
Nietzsche shifts the essence and principle of being
to a new center of gravity, by substituting the Future
for the Present and relying on the untrammeled
expansion of spontaneous forces which upon
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>
closer examination are found to be without definite
aim or practical goal.</p>

<p>For this reason, critically to animadvert upon
Nietzsche as a social reformer would be utterly
out of place; he is simply too much of a poet to
be taken seriously as a statesman or politician.
The weakness of his philosophy before the forum
of Logic has been referred to before. Nothing
can be easier than to prove the incompatibility of
some of his theorems. How, for instance, can the
absolute determinism of the belief in Cyclic Recurrence
be reconciled with the power vested in
superman to deflect by his autonomous will the
straight course of history? Or, to touch upon a
more practical social aspect of his teaching,&mdash;if
in the order of nature all men are unequal, how
can we ever bring about the right selection of
leaders, how indeed can we expect to secure the
due ascendancy of character and intellect over the
gregarious grossness of the demos?</p>

<p>Again, it is easy enough to controvert Nietzsche
almost at any pass by demonstrating his unphilosophic
onesidedness. Were Nietzsche not stubbornly
onesided, he would surely have conceded&mdash;as
any sane-minded person must concede in these
times of suffering and sacrifice&mdash;that charity, self-abnegation,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" title="154"> </a>
and self-immolation might be viewed,
not as conclusive proofs of degeneracy, but on
the contrary as signs of growth towards perfection.
Besides, philosophers of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">métier</i> are sure
to object to the haziness of Nietzsche's idea of
Vitality which in truth is oriented, as is his philosophy
in general, less by thought than by sentiment.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his obvious connection with
significant contemporaneous currents, the author
of &ldquo;Zarathustra&rdquo; is altogether too much <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>
to be amenable to any crude and rigid classification.
He may plausibly be labelled an anarchist,
yet no definition of anarchism will wholly take
him in. Anarchism stands for the demolition of
the extant social apparatus of restraint. Its battle
is for the free determination of personal happiness.
Nietzsche's prime concern, contrarily, is
with internal self-liberation from the obsessive desire
for personal happiness in any accepted connotation
of the term; such happiness to him does
not constitute the chief object of life.</p>

<p>The cardinal point of Nietzsche's doctrine is
missed by those who, arguing retrospectively, expound
the gist of his philosophy as an incitation
to barbarism. Nothing can be more remote from
his intentions than the transformation of society
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" title="155"> </a>
into a horde of ferocious brutes. His impeachment
of mercy, notwithstanding an appearance of
reckless impiety, is in the last analysis no more and
no less than an expedient in the truly romantic pursuit
of a new ideal of Love. Compassion, in his
opinion, hampers the progress towards forms of
living that shall be pregnant with a new and superior
type of perfection. And in justice to Nietzsche
it should be borne in mind that among the
various manifestations of that human failing there
is none he scorns so deeply as cowardly and petty
commiseration of self. It also deserves to be emphasized
that he nowhere endorses selfishness
when exercised for small or sordid objects. &ldquo;I
love the brave. But it is not enough to be a
swordsman, one must also know against whom to
use the sword. And often there is more bravery
in one's keeping quiet and going past, in order to
spare one's self for a worthier enemy: Ye shall
have only enemies who are to be hated, but not
enemies who are to be despised.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">(27)</a> Despotism
must justify itself by great and worthy ends. And
no man must be permitted to be hard towards
others who lacks the strength of being even harder
towards himself.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" title="156"> </a>At all events it must serve a better purpose to
appraise the practical importance of Nietzsche's
speculations than blankly to denounce their immoralism.
Nietzsche, it has to be repeated, was
not on the whole a creator of new ideas. His
extraordinary influence in the recent past is not
due to any supreme originality or fertility of mind;
it is predominantly due to his eagle-winged imagination.
In him the emotional urge of utterance
was, accordingly, incomparably more potent
than the purely intellectual force of opinion: in
fact the texture of his philosophy is woven of sensations
rather than of ideas, hence its decidedly
ethical trend.</p>

<p>The latent value of Nietzsche's ethics in their
application to specific social problems it would be
extremely difficult to determine. Their successful
application to general world problems, if it were
possible, would mean the ruin of the only form
of civilization that signifies to us. His philosophy,
if swallowed in the whole, poisons; in large potations,
intoxicates; but in reasonable doses,
strengthens and stimulates. Such danger as it
harbors has no relation to grossness. His call to
the Joy of Living and Doing is no encouragement
of vulgar hedonism, but a challenge to persevering
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" title="157"> </a>
effort. He urges the supreme importance of vigor
of body and mind and force of will. &ldquo;O my
brethren, I consecrate you to be, and show unto
you the way unto a new nobility. Ye shall become
procreators and breeders and sowers of the
future.&mdash;Not whence ye come be your honor in
future, but whither ye go! Your will, and your
foot that longeth to get beyond yourselves, be
that your new honor!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">(28)</a></p>

<p>It would be a withering mistake to advocate the
translation of Nietzsche's poetic dreams into the
prose of reality. Unquestionably his Utopia if
it were to be carried into practice would doom to
utter extinction the world it is devised to regenerate.
But it is generally acknowledged that
&ldquo;prophets have a right to be unreasonable,&rdquo; and
so, if we would square ourselves with Friedrich
Nietzsche in a spirit of fairness, we ought not to
forget that the daring champion of reckless unrestraint
is likewise the inspired apostle of action,
power, enthusiasm, and aspiration, in fine, a
prophet of Vitality and a messenger of Hope.

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>IV<br/>
<small>THE REVIVALISM OF LEO TOLSTOY</small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the intellectual record of our times it is one
of the oddest events that the most impressive
preacher who has taken the ear of civilized
mankind in this generation raised up his voice
in a region which in respect of its political, religious,
and economic status was until recently, by
fairly common consent, ruled off the map of Europe.
The greatest humanitarian of his century
sprang up in a land chiefly characterized in the
general judgment of the outside world by the
reactionism of its government and the stolid
ignorance of its populace. A country still teeming
with analphabeticians and proverbial for its dense
medievalism gave to the world a writer who by
the great quality of his art and the lofty spiritualism
of his teaching was able not only to obtain a
wide hearing throughout all civilized countries,
but to become a distinct factor in the moral evolution
of the age. The stupefying events that have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>
recently revolutionized the Russian state have
given the world an inkling of the secrets of the
Slavic type of temperament, so mystifying in its
commixture of simplicity and strength on the one
hand with grossness and stupidity, and on the other
hand with the highest spirituality and idealism.
For such people as in these infuriated times still
keep up some objective and judicious interest in
products of the literary art, the volcanic upheaval
in the social life of Russia has probably thrown
some of Tolstoy's less palpable figures into a
greater plastic relief. Tolstoy's own character,
too, has become more tangible in its curious composition.
The close analogy between his personal
theories and the dominant impulses of his race
has now been made patent. We are better able to
understand the people of whom he wrote because
we have come to know better the people for whom
he wrote.</p>

<p>The emphasis of Tolstoy's popular appeal was
unquestionably enhanced by certain eccentricities
of his doctrine, and still more by his picturesque
efforts to conform his mode of life, by way of
necessary example, to his professed theory of
social elevation. The personality of Tolstoy, like
the character of the Russian people, is many-sided,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>
and since its aspects are not marked off by convenient
lines of division, but are, rather, commingled
in the great and varied mass of his literary
achievements, it is not easy to make a definitive
forecast of his historic position. Tentatively,
however, the current critical estimate may be
summed up in this: as a creative writer, in particular
of novels and short stories, he stood matchless
among the realists, and the verdict pronounced
at one time by William Dean Howells when he
referred to Tolstoy as &ldquo;the only living writer of
perfect fiction&rdquo; is not likely to be overruled by
posterity. Nor will competent judges gainsay his
supreme importance as a critic and moral revivalist
of society, even though they may be seriously
disposed to question whether his principles of conduct
constitute in their aggregate a canon of much
practical worth for the needs of the western world.
As a philosopher or an original thinker, however,
he will hardly maintain the place accorded him
by the less discerning among his multitudinous followers,
for in his persistent attempt to find a
new way of understanding life he must be said to
have signally failed. Wisdom in him was hampered
by Utopian fancies; his dogmas derive from
idiosyncrasies and lead into absurdities. Then,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>
too, most of his tenets are easily traced to their
sources: in his vagaries as well as in his noblest
and soundest aspirations he was merely continuing
work which others had prepared.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>An objective survey of Tolstoy's work in realistic
fiction, in which he ranked supreme, should
start with the admission that he was by no means
the first arrival among the Russians in that field.
Nicholas Gogol, Fedor Dostoievsky, and Ivan
Turgenieff had the priority by a small margin.
Of these three powerful novelists, Dostoievsky
(1821&ndash;1881) has probably had an even stronger
influence upon modern letters than has Tolstoy
himself. He was one of the earliest writers of
romance to show the younger generation how to
found fiction upon deeper psychologic knowledge.
His greatest proficiency lay, as is apt to be the
case with writers of a realistic bent, in dealing with
the darkest side of life. The wretched and outcast
portion of humanity yielded to his skill its
most congenial material. His novels&mdash;&ldquo;Poor
Folk,&rdquo; (1846), &ldquo;Memoirs from a Dead House,&rdquo;
(1862), &ldquo;Raskolnikoff,&rdquo; (1866), &ldquo;The Idiot,&rdquo;
(1868), &ldquo;The Karamasoffs,&rdquo; (1879)&mdash;take the
reader into company such as had heretofore
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>
not gained open entrance to polite literature:
criminals, defectives, paupers, and prostitutes.
Yet he did not dwell upon the wretchedness
of that submerged section of humanity from any
perverse delight in what is hideous or for the satisfaction
of readers afflicted with morbid curiosity,
but from a compelling sense of pity and
brotherly love. His works are an appeal to charity.
In them, the imperdible grace of the soul
shines through the ugliest outward disguise to win
a glance from the habitual indifference of fortune's
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfants gâtés</i>. Dostoievsky preceded Tolstoy
in frankly enlisting his talents in the service
of his outcast brethren. With the same ideal of
the writer's mission held in steady view, Tolstoy
turned his attention from the start, and then more
and more as his work advanced, to the pitiable
condition of the lower orders of society. It must
not be forgotten in this connection that his career
was synchronous with the growth of a social revolution
which, having reached its full force in these
days, is making Russia over for better or for
worse, and whose wellsprings Tolstoy helps us to
fathom.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>For the general grouping of his writings it is
convenient to follow Tolstoy's own division of his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" title="166"> </a>
life. His dreamy poetical childhood was succeeded
by three clearly distinct stages: first, a
score of years filled up with self-indulgent worldliness;
next, a nearly equal length of time devoted
to artistic ambition, earnest meditation, and helpful
social work; last, by a more gradual transition,
the ascetic period, covering a long stretch of
years given up to religious illumination and to the
strenuous advocacy of the Simple Life.</p>

<p>The remarkable spiritual evolution of this great
man was apparently governed far more by inborn
tendencies than by the workings of experience. Of
Tolstoy in his childhood, youth, middle age, and
senescence we gain trustworthy impressions from
numerous autobiographical documents, but here
we shall have to forego anything more than a passing
reference to the essential facts of his career.
He was descended from an aristocratic family of
German stock but domiciled in Russia since the
fourteenth century. The year of his birth was
1828, the same as Ibsen's. In youth he was
bashful, eccentric, and amazingly ill-favored.
The last-named of these handicaps he outgrew
but late in life, still later did he get over his
bashfulness, and his eccentricity never left him.
His penchant for the infraction of custom nearly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" title="167"> </a>
put a premature stop to his career when in his
urchin days he once threw himself from a window
in an improvised experiment in aerial navigation.
At the age of fourteen he was much taken up with
subtile speculations about the most ancient and
vexing of human problems: the future life, and the
immortality of the soul. Entering the university
at fifteen, he devoted himself in the beginning to
the study of oriental languages, but later on his
interest shifted to the law. At sixteen he was
already imbued with the doctrines of Jean Jacques
Rousseau that were to play such an important rôle
in guiding his conduct. In 1846 he passed out of
the university without a degree, carrying away
nothing but a lasting regret over his wasted time.
He went directly to his ancestral estates, with
the idealistic intention to make the most of
the opportunity afforded him by the patriarchal
relationship that existed in Russia between the
landholder and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adscripti glebae</i> and to improve
the condition of his seven hundred dependents.
His efforts, however, were foredoomed to
failure, partly through his lack of experience,
partly also through a certain want of sincerity
or tenacity of purpose. The experiment in social
education having abruptly come to its end,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" title="168"> </a>
the disillusionized reformer threw himself headlong
into the diversions and dissipations of the
capital city. In his &ldquo;Confession&rdquo; he refers to
that chapter of his existence as made up wholly
of sensuality and worldliness. He was inordinately
proud of his noble birth,&mdash;at college his inchoate
apostleship of the universal brotherhood
of man did not shield him from a general dislike
on account of his arrogance,&mdash;and he cultivated
the most exclusive social circles of Moscow. He
freely indulged the love of sports that was to cling
through life and keep him strong and supple even
in very old age. (Up to a short time before his
death he still rode horseback and perhaps none of
the renunciations exacted by his principles came so
hard as that of giving up his favorite pastime of
hunting.) But he also fell into the evil ways of
gilded youth, soon achieving notoriety as a toper,
gambler, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">courreur des femmes</i>. After a while
his brother, who was a person of steadier habits
and who had great influence over him, persuaded
him to quit his profligate mode of living and to
join him at his military post. Under the bracing
effect of the change, the young man's moral energies
quickly revived. In the wilds of the Caucasus
he at once grew freer and cleaner; his deep affection
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" title="169"> </a>
for the half-civilized land endeared him both
to the Cossack natives and the Russian soldiers.
He entered the army at twenty-three, and from
November, 1853, up to the fall of Sebastopol in
the summer of 1855, served in the Crimean campaign.
He entered the famous fortress in November,
1854, and was among the last of its
defenders. The indelible impressions made upon
his mind by the heroism of his comrades, the awful
scenes and the appalling suffering he had to
witness, were responsible then and later for descriptions
as harrowing and as stirring as any that
the war literature of our own day has produced.</p>

<p>In the Crimea he made his début as a writer.
Among the tales of his martial period the most
popular and perhaps the most excellent is the one
called &ldquo;The Cossacks.&rdquo; Turgenieff pronounced
it the best short story ever written in Russian, and
it is surely no undue exaggeration to say of Tolstoy's
novelettes in general that in point of technical
mastery they are unsurpassed.</p>

<p>Sick at heart over the unending bloodshed in
the Caucasus the young officer made his way back
to Petrograd, and here, lionized in the salons
doubly, fur his feats at arms and in letters, he
seems to have returned, within more temperate
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" title="170"> </a>
limits, to his former style of living. At any rate,
in his own judgment the ensuing three years were
utterly wasted. The mental inanity and moral
corruption all about him swelled his sense of superiority
and self-righteousness. The glaring
humbug and hypocrisy that permeated his social
environment was, however, more than he could
long endure.</p>

<p>Having resigned his officer's commission he
went abroad in 1857, to Switzerland, Germany,
and France. The studies and observations made
in these travels sealed his resolution to settle down
for good on his domain and to consecrate his life
to the welfare of his peasants. But a survey of
the situation found upon his return made him realize
that nothing could be done for the &ldquo;muzhik&rdquo;
without systematic education: therefore, in order
to prepare himself for efficacious work as a
teacher, he spent some further time abroad for
special study, in 1859. After that, the educational
labor was taken up in full earnest. The lord of
the land became the schoolmaster of his subjects,
reenforcing the effect of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i> teaching by
means of a periodical published expressly for their
moral uplift. This work he continued for about
three years, his hopes of success now rising, now
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" title="171"> </a>
falling, when in a fit of despondency he again
abandoned his philanthropic efforts. About this
time, 1862, he married Sophia Andreyevna Behrs,
the daughter of a Moscow physician. With characteristic
honesty he forced his private diary on
his fiancée, who was only eighteen, so that she
might know the full truth about his pre-conjugal
course of living.</p>

<p>About the Countess Tolstoy much has been said
in praise and blame. Let her record speak for
itself. Of her union with the great novelist thirteen
children were born, of whom nine reached an
adult age. The mother nursed and tended them
all, with her own hands made their clothes, and
until they grew to the age of ten supplied to them
the place of a schoolmistress. It must not be
inferred from this that her horizon did not extend
beyond nursery and kitchen, for during the earlier
years she acted also as her husband's invaluable
amanuensis. Before the days of the typewriter
his voluminous manuscripts were all copied by her
hand, and recopied and revised&mdash;in the case of
&ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; this happened no less than
seven times, and the novel runs to sixteen hundred
close-printed pages!&mdash;and under her supervision
his numerous works were not only printed but also
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" title="172"> </a>
published and circulated. Moreover, she managed
his properties, landed, personal, and literary,
to the incalculable advantage of the family fortune.
This end, to be sure, she accomplished by
conservative and reliable methods of business; for
while of his literary genius she was the greatest
admirer, she never was in full accord with his
communistic notions. And the highest proof of
all her extraordinary <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tüchtigkeit</i> and devotion is
that by her common sense and tact she was enabled
to function for a lifetime as a sort of buffer
between her husband's world-removed dreamland
existence and the rigid and frigid reality of
facts.</p>

<p>Thus Tolstoy's energies were left to go undivided
into literary production; its amount, as a result,
was enormous. If all his writings were to be
collected, including the unpublished manuscripts
now reposing in the Rumyantzoff Museum, which
are said to be about equal in quantity to the published
works, and if to this collection were added
his innumerable letters, most of which are of
very great interest, the complete set of Tolstoy's
works would run to considerably more than one
hundred volumes. To discuss all of Tolstoy's
writings, or even to mention all, is here quite out
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" title="173"> </a>
of the question. All those, however, that seem
vital for the purpose of a just estimate and characterization
will be touched upon.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>The literary fame of Tolstoy was abundantly
secured already in the earlier part of his life by
his numerous short stories and sketches. The
three remarkable pen pictures of the siege of
Sebastopol, and tales such as &ldquo;The Cossacks,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Two Hussars,&rdquo; &ldquo;Polikushka,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Snow-Storm,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Encounter,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Invasion,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Captive in the Caucasus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lucerne,&rdquo; &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo;
and many others, revealed together with an exceptional
depth of insight an extraordinary plastic
ability and skill of motivation; in fact they deserve
to be set as permanent examples before the
eyes of every aspiring author. In their characters
and their setting they present true and racy pictures
of a portentous epoch, intimate studies of
the human soul that are full of charm and fascination,
notwithstanding their tragic sadness of outlook.
Manifestly this author was a prose poet of
such marvelous power that he could abstain consistently
from the use of sweeping color, overwrought
sentiment, and high rhetorical invective.</p>

<p>At this season Tolstoy, while he refrained from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" title="174"> </a>
following any of the approved literary models,
was paying much attention to the artistic refinement
of his style. There was to be a time when
he would abjure all considerations of artistry on
the ground that by them the ethical issue in a narration
is beclouded. But it would be truer to say
conversely that in his own later works, since &ldquo;Anna
Karenina,&rdquo; the clarity of the artistic design was
dimmed by the <ins title="obstrusive">obtrusive</ins> didactic purpose. Fortunately
the artistic interest was not yet wholly
subordinated to the religious urge while the three
great novels were in course of composition: &ldquo;War
and Peace,&rdquo; (1864&ndash;69), &ldquo;Anna Karenina,&rdquo; (first
part, 1873; published complete in 1877), and
&ldquo;Resurrection,&rdquo; (1899). To the first of these is
usually accorded the highest place among all of
Tolstoy's works; it is by this work that he takes
his position as the chief epic poet of modern times.
&ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; is indeed an epic rather than
a novel in the ordinary meaning. Playing against
the background of tremendous historical transactions,
the narrative sustains the epic character not
only in the hugeness of its dimensions, but equally
in the qualities of its technique. There is very little
comment by the author upon the events, and
merely a touch of subjective irony here and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" title="175"> </a>
there. The story is straightforwardly told as it
was lived out by its characters. Tolstoy has not
the self-complacency to thrust in the odds and ends
of his personal philosophy, as is done so annoyingly
even by a writer of George Meredith's consequence,
nor does he ever treat his readers with the
almost simian impertinence so successfully affected
by a Bernard Shaw. If &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; has any
faults, they are the faults of its virtues, and
spring mainly from an unmeasured prodigality of
the creative gift. As a result of Tolstoy's excessive
range of vision, the orderly progress of events
in that great novel is broken up somewhat by the
profusion of shapes that monopolize the attention
one at a time much as individual spots in a landscape
do under the sweeping glare of the search-light.
Yet although in the externalization of this
crowding multitude of figures no necessary detail
is lacking, the grand movement as a whole is not
swamped by the details. The entire story is governed
by the conception of events as an emanation
of the cosmic will, not merely as the consequence
of impulses proceeding from a few puissant geniuses
of the Napoleonic order.</p>

<p>It is quite in accord with such a view of history
that the machinery of this voluminous epopee
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" title="176"> </a>
is not set in motion by a single conspicuous protagonist.
As a matter of fact, it is somewhat baffling
to try to name the principals in the story,
since in artistic importance all the figures are on
an equal footing before their maker; possibly the
fact that Tolstoy's ethical theory embodied the
most persistent protest ever raised against the
inequality of social estates proved not insignificant
for his manner of characterization. Ethical justice,
however, is carried to an artistic fault, for the
feelings and reactions of human nature in so many
diverse individuals lead to an intricacy and subtlety
of motivation which obscures the organic causes
through overzeal in making them patent. Anyway,
Tolstoy authenticates himself in this novel
as a past master of realism, particularly in his
utterly convincing depictment of Russian soldier
life. And as a painter of the battlefield he ranks,
allowing for the difference of the medium, with
Vasili Verestschagin at his best. It may be said
in passing that these two Russian pacifists, by
their gruesome exposition of the horrors of war,
aroused more sentiment against warfare than did
all the spectacular and expensive peace conferences
inaugurated by the crowned but hollow head of
their nation, and the splendid declamations of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>
possessors of, or aspirants for, the late Mr.
Nobel's forty-thousand dollar prize.</p>

<p>Like all true realists, Tolstoy took great pains
to inform himself even about the minutiæ of his
subjects, but he never failed, as did in large
measure Zola in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Débâcle</i>, to infuse emotional
meaning into the static monotony of facts and figures.
In his strong attachment for his own human
creatures he is more nearly akin to the idealizing
or sentimentalizing type of realists, like Daudet,
Kipling, Hauptmann, than to the downright matter-of-fact
naturalists such as Zola or Gorki. But
to classify him at all would be wrong and futile,
since he was never leagued with literary creeds
and cliques and always stood aloof from the heated
theoretical controversies of his time even after
he had hurled his great inclusive challenge to art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; was written in Tolstoy's happiest
epoch, at a time, comparatively speaking, of
spiritual calm. He had now reached some satisfying
convictions in his religious speculations, and
felt that his personal life was moving up in the
right direction. His moral change is made plain
in the contrast between two figures of the story,
Prince Andrey and Peter Bezukhoff: the ambitious
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>
worldling and the honest seeker after the
right way.</p>

<p>In his second great novel, &ldquo;Anna Karenina,&rdquo;
the undercurrent of the author's own moral experience
has a distinctly greater carrying power. It is
through the earnest idealist, Levine, that Tolstoy
has recorded his own aspirations. Characteristically,
he does not make Levine the central figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anna Karenina&rdquo; is undoubtedly far from
&ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; reading, since it is the tragical recital
of an adulterous love. But the situation, with its
appalling consequence of sorrow, is seized in its
fullest psychological depth and by this means
saved from being in any way offensive. The relation
between the principals is viewed as by no
means an ordinary liaison. Anna and Vronsky
are serious-minded, honorable persons, who have
struggled conscientiously against their mutual enchantment,
but are swept out of their own moral
orbits by the resistless force of Fate. This fatalistic
element in the tragedy is variously emphasized;
so at the beginning of the story, where
Anna, in her emotional confusion still half-ignorant
of her infatuation, suddenly realizes her love
for Vronsky; or in the scene at the horse races
where he meets with an accident. Throughout the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>
narrative the psychological argumentation is beyond
criticism. Witness the description of Anna's
husband, a sort of cousin-in-kind of Ibsen's Thorvald
Helmer, reflecting on his future course after
his wife's confession of her unfaithfulness. Or
that other episode, perhaps the greatest of them
all, when Anna, at the point of death, joins together
the hands of her husband and her lover.
Or, finally, the picture of Anna as she deserts her
home leaving her son behind in voluntary expiation
of her wrong-doing, an act, by the way, that
betrays a nicety of conscience far too subtle for
the Rhadamantine inquisitors who demand to
know why, if Anna would atone to Karenin, does
she go with Vronsky? How perfectly true to life,
subsequently, is the rapid <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dégringolade</i> of this passion
under the gnawing curse of the homeless,
workless, purposeless existence which little by
little disunites the lovers! Only the end may be
somewhat open to doubt, with its metastasis of
the heroine's character,&mdash;unless indeed we consider
the sweeping change accounted for by the
theory of duplex personality. She herself believes
that there are two quite different women alive in
her, the one steadfastly loyal to her obligations,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>
the other blindly driven into sin by the demon of
her uncontrollable temperament.</p>

<p>In the power of analysis, &ldquo;Anna Karenina&rdquo; is
beyond doubt Tolstoy's masterpiece, and yet in
its many discursive passages it already foreshadows
the disintegration of his art, or more precisely,
its ultimate capitulation to moral propagandism.
For it was while at work upon this
great novel that the old perplexities returned to
bewilder his soul. In the tumultuous agitation of
his conscience, the crucial and fundamental questions,
Why Do We Live? and How Should We
Live? could nevermore be silenced. Now a definitive
attitude toward life is forming; to it all the
later works bear a vital relation. And so, in regard
to their moral outlook, Tolstoy's books may
fitly be divided into those written before and those
written since his &ldquo;conversion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anna Karenina&rdquo;
happens to be on the dividing line.</p>

<p>He was a man well past fifty, of enviable social
position, in prosperous circumstances, widely celebrated
for his art, highly respected for his character,
and in his domestic life blessed with every
reason for contentment. Yet all the gifts of fortune
sank into insignificance before that vexing,
unanswered Why? In the face of a paralyzing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181"> </a>
universal aimlessness, there could be to him no
abiding sense of life in his personal enjoyments
and desires. The burden of life became still less
endurable face to face with the existence of evil
and with the wretchedness of our social arrangements.
With so much toil and trouble, squalor,
ignorance, crime, and every conceivable kind of
bodily and mental suffering all about me, why
should I be privileged to live in luxury and idleness?
This ever recurring question would not
permit him to enjoy his possessions without self-reproach.
To think of thousands of fellowmen
lacking the very necessaries, made affluence and its
concomitant ways of living odious to him. We
know that in 1884, or thereabouts, he radically
changed his views and modes of life so as to bring
them into conformity with the laws of the Gospel.
But before this conversion, in the despairing anguish
that attacked him after the completion of
&ldquo;Anna Karenina,&rdquo; he was frequently tempted to
suicide. Although the thought of death was very
terrible to him then and at all times, still he would
rather perish than live on in a world made heinous
and hateful by the iniquity of men. Then it was
that he searched for a reason why the vast proportion
of humanity endure life, nay enjoy it, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" title="182"> </a>
why self-destruction is condemned by the general
opinion, and this in spite of the fact that for most
mortals existence is even harder than it could have
been for him, since he at least was shielded from
material want and lived amid loving souls. The
answer he found in the end seemed to lead by a
straight road out of the wilderness of doubt and
despair. The great majority, so he ascertained,
are able to bear the burden of life because they
heed the ancient injunction: &ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ora et labora</i>&rdquo;; they
<em>work</em> and they <em>believe</em>. Might he not sweeten his
lot after the same prescription? Being of a delicate
spiritual sensibility, he had long realized that
people of the idle class were for the most part inwardly
indifferent to religion and in their actions
defiant of its spirit. In the upper strata of society
religious thought, where it exists, is largely adulterated
or weakened; sophisticated by education,
doctored by science, thinned out with worldly ambitions
and with practical needs and considerations.
The faith that supports life is found only among
simple folk. For faith, to deserve the name, must
be absolute, uncritical, unreasoning. Starting
from these convictions as a basis, Tolstoy resolutely
undertook <em>to learn to believe</em>; a determination
which led him, as it has led other ardent religionists,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183"> </a>
so far astray from ecclesiastical paths
that in due course of time he was unavoidably
excommunicated from his church. His convictions
made him a vehement antagonist of churchdom
because of its stiffness of creed and laxness of
practice. For his own part he soon arrived at a
full and absolute acceptance of the Christian faith
in what he considered to be its primitive and essential
form. In &ldquo;Walk Ye in the Light,&rdquo;
(1893), the reversion of a confirmed worldling to
this original conception of Christianity gives the
story of the writer's own change of heart.</p>

<p>To the period under discussion belongs Tolstoy's
drama, &ldquo;The Power of Darkness,&rdquo;
(1886).<a name="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">(29)</a> It is a piece of matchless realism, probably
the first unmixedly naturalistic play ever
wrought out. It is brutally, terribly true to life,
and that to life at its worst, both in respect of
the plot and the actors, who are individualized
down to the minutest characteristics of utterance
and gesture. Withal it is a species of modern morality,
replete with a reformatory purpose that reflects
deeply the author's tensely didactic state of
mind. His instructional zeal is heightened by intimate
knowledge of the Russian peasant, on his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" title="184"> </a>
good side as well as on his bad. Some of his short
stories are crass pictures of the muzhik's bestial
degradation, veritable pattern cards of human and
inhuman vices. In other stories, again, the deep-seated
piety of the muzhik, and his patriarchal
simplicity of heart are portrayed. As instance,
the story of &ldquo;Two Old Men,&rdquo; (1885), who are
pledged to attain the Holy Land: the one performs
his vow to the letter, the other, much the
godlier of the two, is kept from his goal by a
work of practical charity. In another story a
muzhik is falsely accused of murder and accepts
his undeserved punishment in a devout spirit of
non-resistance. In a third, a poor cobbler who
intuitively walks in the light is deemed worthy of
a visit from Christ.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;The Power of Darkness,&rdquo; the darkest
traits of peasant life prevail, yet the frightful picture
is somehow Christianized, as it were, so that
even the miscreant Nikita, in spite of his monstrous
crimes, is sure of our profound compassion.
We are gripped at the very heartstrings by that
great confession scene where he stutters out his
budget of malefactions, forced by his awakened
conscience and urged on by his old father: &ldquo;Speak
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>
out, my child, speak it off your soul, then you will
feel easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Power of Darkness&rdquo; was given its counterpart
in the satirical comedy, &ldquo;Fruits of Culture,&rdquo;
(1889). The wickedness of refined society
is more mercilessly excoriated than low-lived infamy.
But artistically considered the peasant
tragedy is far superior to the &ldquo;society play.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Tolstoy was a pessimist both by temperament
and philosophical persuasion. This is made manifest
among other things by the prominent place
which the idea of Death occupies in his writings.
His feelings are expressed with striking simplicity
by one of the principal characters in &ldquo;War and
Peace&rdquo;: &ldquo;One must often think of death, so that
it may lose its terrors for us, cease to be an enemy,
and become on the contrary a friend that delivers
us from this life of miseries.&rdquo; Still, in Tolstoy's
stories, death, as a rule, is a haunting spectre. This
conception comes to the fore even long after his
conversion in a story like &ldquo;Master and Man.&rdquo;
Throughout his literary activity it has an obsessive
hold on his mind. Even the shadowing of
the animal mind by the ubiquitous spectre gives
rise to a story: &ldquo;Cholstomjer, The Story of a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>
Horse,&rdquo; (1861), and in one of the earlier tales
even the death of a tree is pictured. Death is
most terrifying when, denuded of its heroic embellishments
in battle pieces such as &ldquo;The Death
of a Soldier&rdquo; (&ldquo;Sebastopol&rdquo;) or the description
of Prince Andrey's death in &ldquo;War and Peace,&rdquo; it
is exposed in all its bare and grim loathsomeness.
Such happens in the short novel published in 1886
under the name of &ldquo;The Death of Ivan Ilyitch,&rdquo;&mdash;in
point of literary merit one of Tolstoy's greatest
performances. It is a plain tale about a middle-aged
man of the official class, happy in an
unreflecting sort of way in the jog-trot of his work
and domestic arrangements. Suddenly his fate is
turned,&mdash;by a trite mishap resulting in a long,
hopeless sickness. His people at first give him the
most anxious care, but as the illness drags on
their devotion gradually abates, the patient is
neglected, and soon almost no thought is given to
him. In the monotonous agony of his prostration,
the sufferer slowly comes to realize that he is
dying, while his household has gone back to its
habitual ways mindless of him, as though he were
already dead, or had never lived. All through this
lengthened crucifixion he still clings to life, and it
is only when the family, gathering about him
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>
shortly before the release, can but ill conceal their
impatience for the end, that Ivan at last accepts
his fate: &ldquo;I will no longer let them suffer&mdash;I
will die; I will deliver them and myself.&rdquo; So he
dies, and the world pursues its course unaltered,&mdash;in
which consists the after-sting of this poignant
tragedy.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Between the years 1879 and 1886 Tolstoy published
the main portion of what may be regarded
as his spiritual autobiography, namely, &ldquo;The Confession,&rdquo;
(1879, with a supplement in 1882),
&ldquo;The Union and Translation of the Four Gospels,&rdquo;
(1881&ndash;2), &ldquo;What Do I Believe?&rdquo; (also
translated under the title &ldquo;My Religion,&rdquo; 1884)
and &ldquo;What Then Must We Do?&rdquo; (1886). He
was now well on the way to the logical ultimates
of his ethical ideas, and in the revulsion from artistic
ambitions so plainly foreshown in a treatise
in 1887: &ldquo;What is True Art?&rdquo; he repudiated unequivocally
all his earlier work so far as it sprang
from any motives other than those of moral teaching.
Without a clear appreciation of these facts a
just estimate of &ldquo;The Kreutzer Sonata&rdquo; (1889)
is impossible.</p>

<p>The central character of the book is a commonplace,
rather well-meaning fellow who has been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>
tried for the murder of his wife, slain by him in a
fit of insensate jealousy, and has been acquitted
because of the extenuating circumstances in the
case. The object of the story is to lay bare the
causes of his crime. Tolstoy's ascetic proclivity
had long since set him thinking about sex problems
in general and in particular upon the ethics of
marriage. And by this time he had arrived at
the conclusion that the demoralized state of our
society is chiefly due to polygamy and polyandrism;
corroboration of his uncompromising
views on the need of social purity he finds in the
evangelist Matthew, v:27&ndash;28, where the difference
between the old command and its new, far
more rigorous, interpretation is bluntly stated:
&ldquo;Ye have heard that it was said by them of old
time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say
unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to
lust after her hath committed adultery with her
already in his heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Tolstoy thinks that society, far from concurring
in the scriptural condemnation of lewdness,
caters systematically to the appetites of the
voluptuary. If Tolstoy is right in his diagnosis,
then the euphemistic term &ldquo;social evil&rdquo; has far
wider reaches of meaning than those to which it is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" title="189"> </a>
customarily applied. With the head person in
&ldquo;The Kreutzer Sonata,&rdquo; Tolstoy regards society
as no better than a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maison de tolérance</i> conducted
on a very comprehensive scale. Women are
reared with the main object of alluring men
through charms and accomplishments; the arts of
the hairdresser, the dressmaker, and milliner, as
well as the exertions of governesses, music masters,
and linguists all converge toward the same
aim: to impart the power of attracting men. Between
the woman of the world and the professional
courtezan the main difference in the light
of this view lies in the length of the service. Pozdnicheff
accordingly divides femininity into long
term and short term prostitutes, which rather fantastic
classification Tolstoy follows up intrepidly
to its last logical consequence.</p>

<p>The main idea of &ldquo;The Kreutzer Sonata,&rdquo; as
stated in the postscript, is that sexless life is best.
A recommendation of celibacy as mankind's highest
ideal to be logical should involve a wish for
the disappearance of human life from the globe.
A world-view of such pessimistic sort prevents itself
from the forfeiture of all bonds with humanity
only by its concomitant reasoning that a race for
whom it were better not to be is the very one that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>
will struggle desperately against its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i>.
Since race suicide, then, is a hopeless desideratum,
the reformer must turn to more practicable
methods if he would at least alleviate the
worst of our social maladjustments. Idleness is
the mother of all mischief, because it superinduces
sensual self-indulgence. Therefore we must suppress
anything that makes for leisure and pleasure.
At this point we grasp the meaning of Tolstoy's
vehement recoil from art. It is, to a great
extent, the strong-willed resistance of a highly
impressionable puritan against the enticements of
beauty,&mdash;their distracting and disquieting effect,
and principally their power of sensuous suggestion.</p>

<p>The last extensive work published by Tolstoy
was &ldquo;Resurrection,&rdquo; (1889). In artistic merit it
is not on a level with &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anna
Karenina,&rdquo; nor can this be wondered at, considering
the opinion about the value of art that had
meanwhile ripened in the author.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resurrection&rdquo; was written primarily for a constructive
moral purpose, yet the subject matter
was such as to secrete, unintendedly, a corrosive
criticism of social and religious cant. The satirical
connotation of the novel could not have been more
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a>
grimly brought home than through this fact, that
the hero by his unswerving allegiance to Christian
principles of conduct greatly shocks, at first, our
sense of the proprieties, instead of eliciting our
enthusiastic admiration. In spite of our highest
moral notions Prince Nekhludoff, like that humbler
follower of the voice of conscience in Gerhart
Hauptmann's novel, impresses us as a &ldquo;Fool in
Christ.&rdquo; The story, itself, leads by degrees from
the under-world of crime and punishment to a
great spiritual elevation. Maslowa, a drunken
street-walker, having been tried on a charge of
murder, is wrongfully sentenced to transportation
for life, because&mdash;the jury is tired out and the
judge in a hurry to visit his mistress. Prince
Nekhludoff, sitting on that jury, recognizes in the
victim of justice a girl whose downfall he himself
had caused. He is seized by penitence and resolves
to follow the convict to Siberia, share her
sufferings, dedicate his life to her redemption.
She has sunk so low that his hope of reforming
her falters, yet true to his resolution he offers to
marry her. Although the offer is rejected, yet the
suggestion of a new life which it brings begins to
work a change in the woman. In the progress of
the story her better nature gradually gains sway
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>
until a thorough moral revolution is completed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resurrection&rdquo; derives its special value from
its clear demonstration of those rules of conduct
to which the author was straining with every moral
fiber to conform his own life. From his ethical
speculations and social experiments are projected
figures like that of Maria Paulovna, a rich and
beautiful woman who prefers to live like a common
workingwoman and is drawn by her social
conscience into the revolutionary vortex. In this
figure, and more definitely still in the political convict
Simonson, banished because of his educational
work among the common people, Tolstoy studies
for the first time the so-called &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; type
of revolutionist. His view of the &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo;
is sympathetic, on the whole. They believe that
evil springs from ignorance. Their agitation issues
from the highest principles, and they are
capable of any self-sacrifice for the general weal.
Still Tolstoy, as a thoroughly anti-political reformer,
deprecates their organized movement.</p>

<p>Altogether, he repudiated the systems of social
reconstruction that go by the name of socialism,
because he relied for the regeneration of society
wholly and solely upon individual self-elevation.
In an essential respect he was nevertheless a socialist,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>
inasmuch as he strove for the ideal of universal
equality. His social philosophy, bound up
inseparably with his personal religious evolution,
is laid down in a vast number of essays, letters,
sketches, tracts, didactic tales, and perhaps most
comprehensively in those autobiographical documents
already mentioned. Sociologically the most
important of these is a book on the problem of
property, entitled, &ldquo;What Then Must We Do?&rdquo;
(1886), which expounds the passage in Luke
iii:10, 11: &ldquo;And the people asked him, saying,
What shall we do then? He answered and saith
unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart
to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let
him do likewise.&rdquo; Not long before that, he had
thought of devoting himself entirely to charitable
work, but practical experiments at Moscow demonstrated
to him the futility of almsgiving. Speaking
on that point to his English biographer, Aylmer
Maude,<a name="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">(30)</a> he remarked: &ldquo;All such activity, if
people attribute importance to it, is worthless.&rdquo;
When his interviewer insisted that the destitute
have to be provided for somehow and that the
Count himself was in the habit of giving money
to beggars, the latter replied: &ldquo;Yes, but I do not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>
imagine that I am doing good! I only do it for
myself, because I know that I have no right to be
well off while they are in misery.&rdquo; It is worth
mention in passing that during the famine of
1891&ndash;2 this determined opponent of organized
charity, in noble inconsistency with his theories, led
in the dispensation of relief to the starving population
of Middle Russia.</p>

<p>But in &ldquo;What Then Must We Do?&rdquo; he treats
the usual organized dabbling in charity as utterly
preposterous: &ldquo;Give away all you have or else you
can do no good.&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;If I give away a hundred
thousand and still withhold five hundred thousand,
I am far from acting in the spirit of charity, and
remain a factor of social injustice and evil. At the
sight of the freezing and hungering I must still
feel responsible for their plight, and feel that
since we should live in conditions where that evil
can be abstained from, it is impossible for me in
the position in which I deliberately place myself
to be anything other than a source of general
evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was chiefly due to the influence of two peasants,
named Sutayeff and Bondareff, that Tolstoy
decided by a path of religious reasoning to abandon
&ldquo;parasitical existence,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to sacrifice
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" title="195"> </a>
all prerogatives of his wealth and station and to
share the life of the lowly. He reasoned as follows:
&ldquo;Since I am to blame for the existence of
social wrong, I can lessen my blame only by making
myself like unto those that labor and are
heavy-laden.&rdquo; Economically, Tolstoy reasons
from this fallacy: If all men do not participate
equitably in the menial work that has to be performed
in the world, it follows that a disproportionate
burden of work falls upon the shoulders
of the more defenseless portion of humanity.
Whether this undue amount of labor be exacted
in the form of chattel slavery, or, which is scarcely
less objectionable, in the form of the virtual slavery
imposed by modern industrial conditions,
makes no material difference. The evil conditions
are bound to continue so long as the instincts that
make for idleness prevail over the co-operative impulses.
The only remedy lies in the simplification
of life in the upper strata of the social body, overwork
in the laboring classes being the direct result
of the excessive demands for the pleasures and
luxuries of life in the upper classes.</p>

<p>To Bondareff in particular Tolstoy confessedly
owes the conviction that the best preventive for
immorality is physical labor, for which reason the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" title="196"> </a>
lower classes are less widely removed from grace
than the upper. Bondareff maintained on scriptural
grounds that everybody should employ at
least a part of his time in working the land. This
view Tolstoy shared definitely after 1884. Not
only did he devote a regular part of his day to
agricultural labor; he learned, in addition, shoemaking
and carpentry, meaning to demonstrate by
his example that it is feasible to return to those
patriarchal conditions under which the necessities
of life were produced by the consumer himself.
From this time forth he modelled his habits more
and more upon those of the common rustic. He
adopted peasant apparel and became extremely
frugal in his diet. Although by natural taste he
was no scorner of the pleasures of the table, he
now eliminated one luxury after another. About
this time he also turned strict vegetarian, then
gave up the use of wine and spirits, and ultimately
even tobacco, of which he had been very fond, was
made to go the way of flesh. He practiced this
self-abnegation in obedience to the Law of Life
which he interpreted as a stringent renunciation
of physical satisfactions and personal happiness.
Nor did he shirk the ultimate conclusion to which
his premises led: if the Law of Life imposes the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" title="197"> </a>
suppression of all natural desires and appetites
and commands the voluntary sacrifice of every
form of property and power, it must be clear that
life itself is devoid of sense and utterly undesirable.
And so it is expressly stated in his
&ldquo;Thoughts.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">(31)</a></p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>To what extent Tolstoy was a true Christian
believer may best be gathered from his own writings,
&ldquo;What Do I Believe?&rdquo; (1884), &ldquo;On Life,&rdquo;
(1887), and &ldquo;The Kingdom of God is within
You,&rdquo; (1893). Although at the age of seventeen
he had ceased to be orthodox, there can be no
question whatever that throughout his whole life
religion remained the deepest source of his inspiration.
By the early eighties he had emerged
from that acute scepticism that well-nigh cost him
life and reason, and had, outwardly at least, made
his peace with the church, attending services regularly,
and observing the feasts and the fasts; here
again in imitating the muzhik in his religious practices
he strove apparently to attain also to the
muzhik's actual gift of credulity. But in this endeavor
his superior culture proved an impediment
to him, and his widening doctrinal divergence from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" title="198"> </a>
the established church finally drew upon his head,
in 1891, the official curse of the Holy Synod. And
yet a leading religious journal was right, shortly
after his death, in this comment upon the religious
meaning of his life: &ldquo;If Christians everywhere
should put their religious beliefs into practice with
the simplicity and sincerity of Tolstoy, the entire
religious, moral, and social life of the world would
be revolutionized in a month.&rdquo; The orthodox
church expelled him from its communion because
of his radicalism; but in his case radicalism meant
indeed the going to the roots of Christian religion,
to the original foundations of its doctrines. In the
teachings of the <em>primitive</em> church there presented
itself to Tolstoy a dumfoundingly simple code for
the attainment of moral perfection. Hence arose
his opposition to the <em>established</em> church which
seemed to have strayed so widely from its own
fundamentals.</p>

<p>Since Tolstoy's life aimed at the progressive
exercise of self-sacrifice, his religious belief could
be no gospel of joy. In fact, his is a sad, gray,
ascetic religion, wholly devoid of poetry and emotional
uplift. He did not learn to believe in the
divinity of Christ nor in the existence of a God
in any definite sense personal, and it is not even
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
clear whether he believed in an after-life. And
yet he did not wrongfully call himself a Christian,
for the mainspring of his faith and his labor was
the message of Christ delivered to his disciples
in the Sermon on the Mount. This, for Tolstoy,
contained all the philosophy and the theology of
which the modern world stands in need, since in
the precept of non-resistance is joined forever the
issue between the Law and the Gospel: &ldquo;Ye have
heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That
ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee
on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And farther on: &ldquo;Ye have heard that it hath
been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate
thine enemy. But I say unto you. Love your
enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully
use you, and persecute you.&rdquo;&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p>In this commandment Tolstoy found warrant
for unswerving forbearance toward every species
of private and corporate aggression. Offenders
against individuals or the commonwealth deserve
nothing but pity. Prisons should be abolished and
criminals never punished. Tolstoy went so far
as to declare that even if he saw his own wife or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" title="200"> </a>
daughters being assaulted, he would abstain from
using force in their defense. The infliction of the
death penalty was to him the most odious of
crimes. No life, either human or animal, should
be wilfully destroyed.</p>

<p>The doctrine of non-resistance removes every
conceivable excuse for war between the nations.
A people is as much bound as is an individual by
the injunction: &ldquo;Whosoever shall smite thee on
the right cheek, turn to him the other also.&rdquo; War
is not to be justified on patriotic grounds, for
patriotism, far from being a virtue, is an enlarged
and unduly glorified form of selfishness. Consistently
with his convictions, Tolstoy put forth
his strength not for the glory of his nation but for
the solidarity of mankind.</p>

<p>The cornerstones of Tolstoy's religion, then,
were these three articles of faith. First, True
Faith gives Life. Second, Man must live by labor.
Third, Evil must never be resisted by means of
evil.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Outside of the sphere of religious thought it is
inaccurate to speak of a specific Tolstoyan philosophy,
and it is impossible for the student to subscribe
unconditionally to the hackneyed formula of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" title="201"> </a>
the books that Tolstoy &ldquo;will be remembered as
perhaps the most profound influence of his day on
human thought.&rdquo; Yet the statement might be
made measurably true if it were modified in accordance
with the important reservation made
earlier in this sketch. In the field of thought he
was not an original explorer. He was great only
as the promulgator, not as the inventor, of ideas.
His work has not enriched the wisdom of man by
a single new thought, nor was he a systematizer
and expounder of thought or a philosopher. In
fact he possessed slight familiarity with philosophical
literature. Among the older metaphysicians
his principal guide was Spinoza, and in more
modern speculative science he did not advance
beyond Schopenhauer. To the latter he was not
altogether unlike in his mental temper. At least
he showed himself indubitably a pessimist in his
works by placing in fullest relief the bad side of
the social state. We perceive the pessimistic disposition
also through his personal behavior, seeing
how he desponded under the discords of life,
how easily he lost courage whenever he undertook
to cope with practical problems, and how sedulously
he avoided the contact with temptations. It
was only by an almost total withdrawal from the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" title="202"> </a>
world, and by that entire relief from its daily and
ordinary affairs which he owed to the devotion of
his wife that Tolstoy was enabled during his later
years to look upon the world less despairingly.</p>

<p>Like his theology, so, too, his civic and economic
creed was marked by the utmost and altogether
too primitive simplicity. Political questions were
of slight interest to him, unless they touched upon
his vital principles. If, therefore, we turn from
his very definite position in matters of individual
conduct to his political views, we shall find that
he was wanting in a program of practical changes.
His only positive contribution to economic discussion
was a persistent advocacy of agrarian reform.
Under the influence of Henry George he became
an eloquent pleader for the single tax and the
nationalization of the land. This question he
discussed in numerous places, with especial force
and clearness in a long article entitled &ldquo;A Great
Iniquity.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">(32)</a> He takes the view that the mission of
the State, if it have any at all, can only consist
in guaranteeing the rights of every one of its
denizens, but that in actual fact the State protects
only the rights of the propertied. Intelligent and
right-minded citizens must not conspire with the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" title="203"> </a>
State to ride rough-shod over the helpless majority.
Keenly alive to the unalterable tendency of
organized power to abridge the rights of individuals
and to dominate both their material and spiritual
existence, Tolstoy fell into the opposite extreme
and would have abolished with a clean sweep
all factors of social control, including the right of
property and the powers of government, and
transformed society into a community of equals
and brothers, relying for its peace and well-being
upon a universal love of liberty and justice.</p>

<p>By his disbelief in authority, the rejection of
the socialists' schemes of reconstruction, his mistrust
of fixed institutions and reliance on individual
right-mindedness for the maintenance of the
common good, Tolstoy in the sphere of civic
thought separated himself from the political socialists
by the whole diameter of initial principle:
he might not unjustly be classified, therefore, as
an anarchist, if this definition were neither too
narrow nor too wide. The Christian Socialists
might claim him, because he aspires ardently to
ideals essentially Christian in their nature, and
there is surely truth in the thesis that &ldquo;every
thinker who understands and earnestly accepts
the teaching of the Master is at heart a socialist.&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" title="204"> </a>
At the same time, Christianity and Socialism
do not travel the whole way together. For
a religion that enjoins patience and submission
can hardly be conducive to the full flowering of
Socialism. And Tolstoy's attitude towards the
church differs radically from that of the Christian
Socialists. On the whole one had best abstain
from classifying men of genius.</p>

<p>The base of Tolstoy's social creed was the non-recognition
of private property. The effect of
the present system is to maintain the inequality
of men and thereby to excite envy and stir up
hatred among them. Eager to set a personal example
and precedent, Tolstoy rendered himself
nominally penniless by making all his property,
real and personal, over to his wife and children.
Likewise he abdicated his copyrights. Thus he
reduced himself to legal pauperism with a completeness
of success that cannot but stir with envy
the bosom of any philanthropist who shares Mr.
Andrew Carnegie's conviction that to die rich is
to die disgraced.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's detractors have cast a plausible suspicion
upon his sincerity. They pointed out
among other things that his relinquishment of
pecuniary profit in his books was apparent, not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" title="205"> </a>
real. Since Russia has no copyright conventions
with other countries, it was merely making a virtue
of necessity to authorize freely the translation
of his works into foreign languages. As for
the Russian editions of his writings, it is said that
in so far as the heavy hand of the censor did not
prevent, the Countess, as her husband's financial
agent, managed quite skilfully to exploit them.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Altogether, did Tolstoy practice what he professed?
Inconsistency between principles and
conduct is a not uncommon frailty of genius, as is
notoriously illustrated by Tolstoy's real spiritual
progenitor, Jean Jacques Rousseau.</p>

<p>Now there are many discreditable stories in
circulation about the muzhik lord of Yasnaya
Polyana. He urged upon others the gospel commands:
&ldquo;Lay not up for yourselves treasures
upon earth&rdquo; and: &ldquo;Take what ye have and give
to the poor,&rdquo; and for his own part lived, according
to report, in sumptuous surroundings. He
went ostentatiously on pilgrimages to holy places,
barefooted but with an expert pedicure attending
him. He dressed in a coarse peasant blouse, but
underneath it wore fine silk and linen. He was
a vegetarian of the strictest observance, yet so
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" title="206"> </a>
much of an epicure that his taste for unseasonable
dainties strained the domestic resources. He
preached simplicity, and according to rumor dined
off priceless plate; taught the equality of men,
and was served by lackies in livery. He abstained
from alcohol and tobacco, but consumed six cups
of strong coffee at a sitting. Finally, he extolled
the sexless life and was the father of thirteen children.
It was even murmured that notwithstanding
his professed affection for the muzhik and his
incessant proclamation of universal equality, the
peasantry of Yasnaya Polyana was the most
wretchedly-treated to be found in the whole province
and that the extortionate landlordism of the
Tolstoys was notorious throughout the empire.</p>

<p>Much of this, to be sure, is idle gossip, unworthy
of serious attention. Nevertheless, there
is evidence enough to show that Tolstoy's insistence
upon a literal acceptance of earlier Christian
doctrines led him into unavoidable inconsistencies
and shamed him into a tragical sense of
dishonesty.</p>

<p>Unquestionably Tolstoy lived very simply and
laboriously for a man of great rank, means, and
fame, but his life was neither hard nor cramped.
Having had no personal experience of garret
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>
and hovel, he could have no first-hand practical
knowledge of the sting of poverty, nor could he
obtain hardship artificially by imposing upon himself
a mild imitation of physical discomfort. For
the true test of penury is not the suffering of to-day
but the oppressive dread of to-morrow. His
ostensible muzhik existence, wanting in none of
the essentials of civilization, was a romance that
bore to the real squalid pauperism of rural Russia
about the same relation that the bucolic make-belief
of Boucher's or Watteau's swains and shepherdesses
bore to the unperfumed truth of a
sheep-farm or a hog-sty. As time passed, and the
sage turned his thoughts to a more rigid enforcement
of his renunciations, it was no easy task for
a devoted wife to provide comfort for him without
shaking him too rudely out of his fond illusion
that he was enduring privations.</p>

<p>After all, then, his practice did not tally with
his theory; and this consciousness of living contrary
to his own teachings was a constant source
of unhappiness which no moral quibbles of his
friends could still.</p>

<p>Yet no man could be farther from being a hypocrite.
If at last he broke down under a burden
of conscience, it was a burden imposed by the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>
reality of human nature which makes it impossible
for any man to live up to intentions of such rigor
as Tolstoy's. From the start he realized that
he did not conform his practice entirely to his
teachings, and as he grew old he was resolved that
having failed to harmonize his life with his beliefs
he would at least corroborate his sincerity
by his manner of dying. Even in this, however,
he was to be thwarted. In his dramatic ending,
still plainly remembered, we feel a grim consistency
with the lifelong defeat of his will to
suffer.</p>

<p>Early in 1910 a student by the name of Manzos
addressed a rebuke to Tolstoy for simulating the
habits of the poor, denouncing his mode of life as
a form of mummery. He challenged the sage to
forsake his comforts and the affections of his
family, and to go forth and beg his way from
place to place. &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; entreated the young
fanatic, &ldquo;and you will be the first true man after
Christ.&rdquo; With his typical large-heartedness, Tolstoy
accepted the reproof and said in the course
of his long reply:<a name="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">(33)</a> &hellip; &ldquo;The fact that I am
living with wife and daughter in terrible and
shameful conditions of luxury when poverty surrounds
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" title="209"> </a>
me on all sides, torments me ever more
and more, and there is not a day when I am not
thinking of following your advice. I thank you
very, very much for your letter.&rdquo; As a matter
of fact, he had more than once before made ready
to put his convictions to a fiery proof by a final
sacrifice,&mdash;leaving his home and spending his remaining
days in utter solitude. But when he
finally proceeded to carry out this ascetic intention
and actually set out on a journey to some vague
and lonely destination, he was foiled in his purpose.
If ever Tolstoy's behavior irresistibly provoked
misrepresentation of his motives it was by
this somewhat theatrical hegira. The fugitive
left Yasnaya Polyana, not alone, but with his two
favorite companions, his daughter Alexandra and
a young Hungarian physician who for some time
had occupied the post of private secretary to him.
After paying a farewell visit to his sister, a nun
cloistered in Shamardin, he made a start for the
Trans-Caucasus. His idea was to go somewhere
near the Tolstoy colony at the Black Sea. But
in an early stage of the journey, a part of which
was made in an ordinary third-class railway compartment,
the old man was overcome by illness
and fatigue. He was moved to a trackman's hut
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" title="210"> </a>
at the station of Astopovo, not farther than eighty
miles from his home, and here,&mdash;surrounded by
his hastily summoned family and tenderly nursed
for five days,&mdash;he expired. Thus he was denied
the summit of martyrdom to which he had aspired,&mdash;a
lonely death, unminded of men.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Even a summary review like this of Tolstoy's
life and labors cannot be concluded without some
consideration of his final attitude toward the esthetic
embodiment of civilization. The development
of his philosophy of self-abnegation had led
irresistibly, as we have seen, to the condemnation
of all self-regarding instincts. Among these, Art
appeared to him as one of the most insidious. He
warned against the cultivation of the beautiful on
the ground that it results in the suppression and
destruction of the moral sense. Already in 1883
it was known that he had made up his mind to
abandon his artistic aspirations out of loyalty to
his moral theory, and would henceforth dedicate
his talents exclusively to the propagation of humanitarian
views. In vain did the dean of Russian
letters, Turgenieff, appeal to him with a
death-bed message: &ldquo;My friend, great writer of
the Russians, return to literary work! Heed my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>
prayer.&rdquo; Tolstoy stood firm in his determination.
Nevertheless, his genius refused to be throttled by
his conscience; he could not paralyze his artistic
powers; he could merely bend them to his moral
aims.</p>

<p>As a logical corollary to his opposition to art
for art's sake, Tolstoy cast from him all his own
writings antedating &ldquo;Confession,&rdquo;&mdash;and denounced
all of them as empty manifestations of
worldly conceit. His authorship of that immortal
novel, &ldquo;War and Peace,&rdquo; filled him with shame
and remorse. His views on Art are plainly and
forcibly expounded in the famous treatise on
&ldquo;What is Art?&rdquo; and in the one on &ldquo;Shakespeare.&rdquo;
In both he maintains that Art, no matter of what
sort, should serve the sole purpose of bringing
men nearer to each other in the common purpose
of right living. Hence, no art work is legitimate
without a pervasive moral design. The only true
touchstone of an art work is the uplifting strength
that proceeds from it. Therefore, a painting like
the &ldquo;Angelus,&rdquo; or a poem like &ldquo;The Man with the
Hoe&rdquo; would transcend in worth the creations of
a Michael Angelo or a Heinrich Heine even as
the merits of Sophocles, Shakespeare, and Goethe
are outmatched in Tolstoy's judgment by those of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>
Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens, and George Eliot.
By the force of this naïve reasoning and his theoretical
antipathy toward true art, he was led to see
in &ldquo;Uncle Tom's Cabin&rdquo; the veritable acme of
literary perfection, for the reason that this book
wielded such an enormous and noble influence
upon the most vital question of its day. He
strongly discountenanced the literary practice of
revamping ancient themes, believing with Ibsen
that modern writers should impart their ideas
through the medium of modern life. Yet at the
same time he was up in arms against the self-styled
&ldquo;moderns&rdquo;! They took their incentives
from science, and this Tolstoy decried, because
science did not fulfill its mission of teaching people
how rightly to live. In this whole matter he reasoned
doggedly from fixed ideas, no matter to
what ultimates the argument would carry him.
For instance, he did not stick at branding Shakespeare
as an utter barbarian, and to explain the
reverence for such &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo; plays as &ldquo;King
Lear&rdquo; as a crass demonstration of imitative
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Art in general is a practice aiming at the production
of the beautiful. But what is &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;?
asked Tolstoy. The current definitions he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213"> </a>
pronounced wrong because they were formulated
from the standpoint of the pleasure-seeker. Such
at least has been the case since the Renaissance.
From that time forward, Art, like all cults of
pleasure, has been evil. To the pleasure-seeker,
the beautiful is that which is enjoyable; hence he
appraises works of art according to their ability
to procure enjoyment. In Tolstoy's opinion this
is no less absurd than if we were to estimate the
nutritive value of food-stuffs by the pleasure accompanying
their consumption. So he baldly declares
that we must abolish beauty as a criterion
of art, or conversely, must establish truth as the
single standard of beauty. &ldquo;The heroine of my
stories whom I strive to represent in all her
beauty, who was ever beautiful, is so, and will
remain so, is Truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His views on art have a certain analogy with
two modern schools,&mdash;much against his will,
since he strenuously disavows and deprecates
everything modern; they make us think on the
one hand of the &ldquo;naturalists,&rdquo; inasmuch as like
them Tolstoy eschews all intentional graces of
style and diction: and on the other hand of the
&ldquo;impressionists,&rdquo; with whom he seems united by
his fundamental definition of art, namely that it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" title="214"> </a>
is the expression of a dominant emotion calculated
to reproduce itself in the reader or beholder.
Lacking, however, a deep and catholic understanding
for art, Tolstoy, in contrast with the
modern impressionists, would restrict artists to
the expression of a single type of sentiments, those
that reside in the sphere of religious consciousness.
To him art, as properly conceived and
practiced, must be ancillary to religion, and its
proper gauge is the measure of its agreement with
accepted moral teachings. Remembering, then,
the primitive form of belief to which Tolstoy contrived
to attain, we find ourselves face to face
with a theory of art which sets up as the final
arbiter the man &ldquo;unspoiled by culture,&rdquo; and he,
in Tolstoy's judgment, is the Russian muzhik.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>This course of reasoning on art is in itself
sufficient to show the impossibility for any modern
mind of giving sweeping assent to Tolstoy's teachings.
And a like difficulty would be experienced
if we tried to follow him in his meditations on any
other major interest of life. Seeking with a tremendous
earnestness of conscience to reduce the
bewildering tangle of human affairs to elementary
simplicity, he enmeshed himself in a new network
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" title="215"> </a>
of contradictions. The effect was disastrous for
the best part of his teaching; his own extremism
stamped as a hopeless fantast a man incontestably
gifted by nature, as few men have been in history,
with the cardinal virtues of a sage, a reformer,
and a missionary of social justice. Because of
this extremism, his voice was doomed to remain
that of one crying in the wilderness.</p>

<p>The world could not do better than to accept
Tolstoy's fundamental prescriptions: simplicity of
living, application to work, and concentration
upon moral culture. But to apply his radical
scheme to existing conditions would amount to a
self-stultification of the race, for it would entail
the unpardonably sinful sacrifice of some of the
finest and most hard-won achievements of human
progress. For our quotidian difficulties his example
promises no solution. The great mass of
us are not privileged to test our individual schemes
of redemption in the leisured security of an ideal
experiment station; not for every man is there a
Yasnaya Polyana, and the Sophia Andreyevnas
are thinly sown in the matrimonial market.</p>

<p>But even though Tolstoyism will not serve as a
means of solving the great social problems, it supplies
a helpful method of social criticism. And its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" title="216"> </a>
value goes far beyond that: the force of his influence
was too great not to have strengthened enormously
the moral conscience of the world; he has
played, and will continue to play, a leading part
in the establishing and safeguarding of democracy.
After all, we do not have to separate meticulously
what is true in Tolstoy's teaching from
what is false in order to acknowledge him as a
Voice of his epoch. For as Lord Morley puts the
matter in the case of Jean Jacques Rousseau:
&ldquo;There are some teachers whose distinction is
neither correct thought, nor an eye for the exigencies
of practical organization, but simply depth
and fervor of the moral sentiment, bringing with
it the indefinable gift of touching many hearts with
love of virtue and the things of the spirit.&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
